A day celebrated yearly since 1991, in honour of the over 700 black high school girls that were slaughtered in Soweto, South Africa, in 1976.</p><p>The deputy governor who expressed optimism that such sentence, would bring about a maximum reduction in rape cases said: “Despite various instruments and laws enacted to protect the rights of the child, we have continued to witness rape cases and other forms of abuse, including sexual harassment, forced marriages, domestic violence, among others.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Orelope-Adefulire said that due to the increase in rape cases and sexual harassment, it was also pertinent to carryout psychiatric evaluation for some men, especially perpetrators of such inhuman act as part of routine checks.</p><p>“A situation where a father impregnates his own daughter or a blood brother impregnates his sister or an uncle impregnating his cousin, cannot be explained and calls for concern. I notice psychopathic tendencies in some men; so we require full support of the law enforcement agencies and the courts to ensure justice and successful prosecution of such offenders” she said.</p><p>She pleaded with members of the public not keep mum about rape issues and violence, and called on parents to report rape cases to the police, in order to expose, prosecute the culprits who would in turn serve as a deterrent to others.</p><p>“The problem we are having is that people, especially victims, do not speak out and report; even when they report to the police, the perpetrators lure them to drop the case,” Orelope-Adefulire said.</p><p>The deputy governor urged parents to be jointly responsible for the upbringing, welfare, safety and security of their children.</p><p>“Parenting is not meant only for the mothers, our fathers too should take full responsibility of providing leadership and direction in the family. Mothers too, should be able to balance their careers with their duties at home” Orelope-Adefulire said.</p><p>Speaking on the abducted Chibok girls issue, Orelope-Adefulire urged the Federal Government to make sure they were brought back alive, and she also reiterated the need to start counseling as well as motivate the children to dispel their fears by assuring them that their rights, safety and security would be guaranteed.&nbsp;</p><p>“The incidence in Chibok, no doubt, has created a lot of trauma in some children, even outside Borno State and all over the country, hence the need for us to reassure them that all is well” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3l%2BlXJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
