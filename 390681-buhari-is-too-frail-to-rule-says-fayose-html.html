I also don’t have anything against General Buhari.</i></p><p><i>“But one thing is certain. The General is too weak, too frail to be President.</i></p><p><i>“He can’t even be the governor of his state let alone being the President of this country.”</i></p><p>He said it was because of the alleged frail health of Buhari that he brought journalists to the venue of the briefing.</p><p>But the Buhari Support Organisation has said that Fayose needs medical help to cure him of his negative obsession with Buhari.</p><p>The Director of Media and Information Technology of the BSO, Dr Chidia Maduekwe, who trained as a medical doctor, said this in response to Fayose’s claim that Buhari was too frail to govern Nigeria.</p><p>Madukwe said, <i>“The Governor of Ekiti state, Mr. Ayo Fayose, is suffering from what we call in medicine, ‘obsessive compulsive disorder’ based on an appetite and a wish to see General Muhammadu Buhari dead.</i></p><p><i>“He is a psychopath whose obsession has altered his sense of rational analysis of situations whenever he hears the name Buhari. Unfortunately, he is not God and does not have control of the life of our revered General.</i></p><p><i>“Fayose should go back home and prepare to defend himself in the case of the massive rigging that led to the stolen mandate he currently enjoys and leave our General alone.”</i></p><p>While trying to establish his point that Buhari’s health was failing, Fayose sat on the three-seater sofa which he said was a replica of the one Buhari sat on in the picture of the alleged interview.</p><p>He insisted that the table lamp and the cupboard in the hotel also matched those Buhari sat on during the said interview in London.</p><p>Pointing at the setting of the suit 880 at the Hilton, Fayose said, <i>“I brought you here to see for yourself the setting of the room in the Hilton where the picture was taken.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Reasons Fayose Wants Buhari Dead - APC</p><p>It will be recalled that the governor of Kano state, Rabiu Kwankwaso, expressed his assurance that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Muhammadu Buhari, is in better health than President Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHp8lXFoZpqlna6ztYyiqmasn6R6p77AoqNmrJ9iv7a4xGaqmrGjYrOixc6snGegpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
