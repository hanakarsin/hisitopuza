The record-breaker is joining the NBC Olympics broadcasting team, the network announced on July 20.</p><p>The news arrived about a month after Michael did commentating work during the Olympic trials in Omaha, Neb.</p><p>"From the moment he joined our team at Trials, Michael's ability to provide insightful analysis, thoughtful commentary and tell entertaining stories was apparent," Molly Solomon, the president of NBC Olympics Production and an executive producer, said in a statement, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "We're thrilled to have him join us in Tokyo and our audience will benefit from hearing the perspective of the most decorated Olympian of all time."</p><p>Michael will be sitting in the booth alongside retired Olympic swimmer, Rowdy Gaines, and sportscaster Dan Hicks.

At the time, Michael stated that he was "done" with swimming and that he "didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore."</p><p>Less than two years later, he came out of retirement. He swam in a 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in May 2014. He decided to return to competitive swimming for himself, and he was less focused on winning medals.</p><p>Michael made the swim team for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. He competed in six events, and he won gold medals for five of them (he earned a silver medal for the 100-meter butterfly).</p><p>His wife, Nicole Johnson Phelps, and his son, Boomer Phelps, were staples in the crowd during Michael's swim events. Boomer became a viral sensation online for cheering on his dad in the stands.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00)</a></p></figure><p>Following the 2016 Olympics, Michael retired again to start a "new chapter" in his life. In 2017, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a> that he could "probably" compete again and win more medals, but that he had "nothing else that [he] want[ed] to accomplish in this sport."</p><p>Though he is done competing for Team USA, it's clear that Michael couldn't stay away from the Olympics for long. Now, he'll be swapping out a swimsuit for a regular suit, and he'll be commentating instead of competing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucicn5qdnGK9qbHLqapmn5%2Beu6h506hkm51dnrtuwMeeZGtoYmZ6sLjYpqeim6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
