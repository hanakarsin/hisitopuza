At least in places like Chicago and NYC, the topography and transit systems allow a good portion of the population to rely on public transportation, but in L.A., it's pretty impractical for most commuters. If your neighborhood doesn't have much parking off the street, it can be a real struggle to find a spot close to home, and that can lead to people engaging in some pretty shameful behaviors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1.</h2><p>Mariah Flores, who calls herself "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicken Tikka Mariah</a>" on Twitter (A+ handle, btw) documented one such incident of car owners behaving badly this week when she spotted two drivers in an hourlong standoff over a spot across the street from her apartment. The scene begins a little after 6 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time with two sedans, one black and one silver, fighting for dominance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This internet hero kept vigil and dutifully documented the entire standoff as soon as she became aware of it. And already the controversy begins. Armchair referees began to debate which car has a rightful claim on the spot, which created a debate on the etiquette of parallel parking. And I'm just going to level with you here and state that I have a clear opinion on this matter and will not be keeping it to myself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AW0IYB0Rqb</a></p>— chicken tikka mariah (@Mrhflrs) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></figure><p>Team Silver Car argues that the black car clearly passed the spot up and then tried to back up to correct their error. Meanwhile, Team Black Car — AKA Team Right Side of History — counters that proper parallel parking protocol requires you pull up in front of the empty space alongside the car in front of it, turn on your signal, and then back into a spot. As far as I'm concerned, this isn't up for debate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DbsbotbcLe</a></p>— chicken tikka mariah (@Mrhflrs) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></figure><p>Adherents to Team Silver's position, however, suggest we don't know what happened before this game of parking chicken. And that's fair. I have also observed people pulling what Team Silver suggests Black Car may have done — which is to say it is possible the driver did indeed miss the spot and attempt to reverse course while the silver car was already trying to seize the space.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/m7ZNh2l98F</a></p>— chicken tikka mariah (@Mrhflrs) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></figure><p>Personally, I'm more comfortable with making the far more likely assumption that the black car was engaged in standard parallel parking etiquette and the silver car either a) doesn't know the rules of parking or, b) decided to throw all decorum out the window rather than spend another hour circling to find a suitable space.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fUV1sgM4G9</a></p>— chicken tikka mariah (@Mrhflrs) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></figure><p>At this point, at least 30 minutes have elapsed and neither car has shown any signs of relenting. They're not only blocking each other from taking the spot but literally blocking oncoming traffic. The disgruntled drivers affected by the standoff lean on their horns in protest. On the East Coast, that's no big thing, but having grown up in California I can tell you that use of the horn is a sign of major aggression.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y5Jko6UcME</a></p>— chicken tikka mariah (@Mrhflrs) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></figure><p>Here's where things take a turn from ridiculous to insane. A spot opens up across the street, yet these two knuckleheads refuse to concede and try for the other spot.
