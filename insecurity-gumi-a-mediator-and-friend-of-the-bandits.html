Reacting to the Kagara abduction, Sheikh Gumi on Wednesday promised to visit Kagara for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation.</p><p>Subsequently, the cleric visited the Tagina forest where he met with the bandits led by their head whose name is given as <strong>Dogo Gide.&nbsp;</strong>Gumi was said to have preached peace and unity to the bandits, assuring them of better attention in their livelihood.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that visiting bandit hideouts across the states has made Sheik Gummi’s name a news headline for a few weeks now.</p><p>The Islamic Scholar has appeared to know even more than the Nigerian army and other security agencies the hideouts of the bandits. Has received more attention with no chaos or bloodshed in all his visits.</p><p><strong>This brings about the question, Is Sheikh Gumi now Nigeria’s mediator between bandits and peaceful citizens? Is he a ‘FRIEND’ of the bandits to restore peace in the North now?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5ByZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmn6Witm6tjKacnaGRqbyzecCnm2aeop6yr7CMqJ1mrJiaeqOtzZ2gratf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
