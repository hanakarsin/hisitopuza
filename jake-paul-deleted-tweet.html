Find out what he said and if he's apologized.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>While YouTuber <a href=#>Jake Paul</a> is known for stirring up controversy — from his ill-fated "marriage" to <a href=#>Tana Mongeau</a> to trash-talking MMA fighters to kicking people out of his Team 10 house — many are saying that he's now gone too far with a tweet that he's since taken down. Jake wrote about anxiety being self-created in said tweet, and the backlash was so intense that he actually removed it from his page.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Paul deleted the tweet</a> about anxiety after Twitter users called it dangerous and offensive. Read on to find out what he said in the tweet. Plus, Jake is now trying to justify what he said, and online users are not having it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Jake Paul's deleted tweet say?</h2><p>The YouTuber is now under fire for undermining the severity of anxiety after a Feb. 17 tweet went viral for all the wrong reasons. Though the tweet has since been deleted, screengrabs show that it allegedly said:</p><p>"Remember anxiety is created by you," the tweet reportedly said. "Sometimes you gotta let life play out and remind yourself to be happy & that the answers will come. Chill your mind out. Go for a walk. Talk with a friend."</p><p>Those who saw the tweet before it was removed shot back at the YouTuber for claiming that anxiety can simply be solved by<br>being "happy." Jake was accused of being insensitive, and of trying to invalidate medical professionals who diagnose anxiety.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jake Paul: *tweets about anxiety*</p><p>The world: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GjnW7yGueE</a></p>— 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐢𝐞🧸 (@kudiiiszn) <a href=#>February 18, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I really can’t believe in 2020 we have Jake Paul of all people telling the masses that mental illness isn’t real.

Several Twitter users expressed that Jake's words could potentially have teenagers thinking that their struggles are invalid and that they can simply put anxious thoughts out of their heads.</p><p>After receiving many messages online in response to his original tweet, Jake deleted it and then put out a statement that had people puzzled.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jake Paul responded to the backlash from his now-deleted tweet.</h2><p>Though some of Jake's followers wanted him to apologize for putting out his tweet about anxiety, the YouTuber defended it. Several hours after deleting the initial sentiment about mental health, Jake wrote that the tweet was effective in "spreading more awareness." He also explained that he has struggled with anxiety.</p><p>"Everyone clowning my tweet[,] but it’s now spreading more awareness about anxiety which I didn’t even know was a thing till I was 18[,] but had it my whole life & never knew how to deal with it," he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>He also linked an article about coping with anxiety below his sentiments, writing "If u think u have it or wanna deal with it[,] try reading this."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The article he attached does encourage people suffering from anxiety to take walks and to try to manage triggers. It is important to note that the article also urges people to seek medical help or treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Jake's brother, Logan Paul, or his ex Tana Mongeau have spoken out about his anxiety tweet. Jake himself has also not elaborated on it aside from his follow-up tweet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ssYypmK6kXZmyrbHTnptmrKeasrU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
