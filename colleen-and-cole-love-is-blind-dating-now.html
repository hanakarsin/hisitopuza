On more than one occasion, he‚Äôs made it clear that Zanab wouldn‚Äôt have been his first choice if he met her out in the real world. In fact, he‚Äôs expressed that he‚Äôs more physically attracted to his ex-connection, Colleen.</p><p>In Episode 5, all five couples reunited for some fun in the sun.

Their flirty conversation continued under the watchful eyes of her man. Shortly after, chaos ensued.</p><p>But did Colleen and Cole actually end up getting together?</p><p>In an October interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today,</a> Colleen opened up about the incident and pretty much confirmed that nothing is (or ever was) going on between her and Cole. She recalled that she was ‚Äúvery uncomfortable in that situation.‚Äù</p><p>"I handled it [by] trying to make the situation nice and make nice comments, and now I know that is extremely inappropriate," she explained.</p><p>According to Colleen, tensions between the foursome have simmered down since then. She told the outlet, "Me, Matt, and Zanab have talked, and we've all moved past it. There was no intention of me trying to cross a line by any means."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Now that rumors about Colleen and Cole have been put to rest, viewers want to know if she and Matt are still going strong. <a href=#>Are Colleen and Matt still together</a> after Season 3?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton still together after Season 3 of ‚ÄòLove Is Blind‚Äô?
