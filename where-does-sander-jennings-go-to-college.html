But now, they're just as invested in the rest of Jazz's family, like her brother <a href=#>Sander</a>. He's one of the twin brothers Jazz has and, as her older sibling, he often looks out for her.</p><p>Sander also has his own storyline in <a href=#>Season 7</a> of I Am Jazz about dating a trans woman for the first time. In the season trailer, Sander wonders if he can handle a serious adult relationship with a woman who has not had "bottom surgery" yet. Some of those in the trans community view bottom surgery as a step in reaffirming their gender identity, though not all opt to take that path.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And with Sander branching out to date a new woman, fans are more curious about him than ever. We all know that Jazz was accepted into <a href=#>Harvard</a>, from which she took a mental health leave of absence. But what about Sander? Does he go to college, or at least work outside of the home? He is an adult, after all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Where does Sander Jennings go to college?</h2><p>Sander <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">graduated</a> from the University of Florida in 2020 after earning his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Master of Mass Communication with a Specialization in Digital Strategy.</p><p>So for some of the recent seasons of I Am Jazz, he did still attend school. As he and his family explain in the Season 7 premiere, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced him and his siblings to put their lives on hold and move back home.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Thankfully, Sander's college education was complete by then. As of now, he plans to continue to build his brand as an influencer and philanthropist. He works with his parents' organization, TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation. Sander also raised more than $10,000 over the course of three years for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Sander has a love interest in Season 7 of 'I Am Jazz.'</h2><p>The Season 7 trailer for I Am Jazz teased Sander's new potential romance with a trans woman named Hope. In a clip obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> ahead of the Dec. 14, 2021 episode, Sander talks to her online. They originally met on the internet and, until this point, they hadn't met in person. Sander says in the clip that he's ready to go on a date with Hope, even if he's nervous about it.</p><p>"Obviously I'm excited," he says in the clip from the episode. "I've never dated a trans woman, but I know that I'm only attracted to women, and trans women are women. Hope just has this radiant personality and I want to get to know her more."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Is there a spark between Sander and Hope? ðŸ¤”âœ¨ Watch all new episodes of <a href=#>#IAmJazz</a>, Tuesdays at 9/8c! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fzUF9d6f3T</a></p>â€” TLC Network (@TLC) <a href=#>December 14, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Does Sander Jennings have a job too?</h2><p>According to Sander's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> profile, his official job title is "influencer."
