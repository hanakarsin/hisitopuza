Bystanders at the Tipper garage junction were lucky that they quickly noticed that the trailer had failed to break, so they quickly scampered for safety.</p><p>“The trailer driver, the passengers, and the occupant of the Police Hilux were not lucky at all, as they all died instantly while people in the Highlander Jeep and Keke NAPEP were seriously injured. About than four people died on the spot.</p><p>“This junction has been a death trap for a long time and nothing has been done to stop it. The FCT Administration should come to our rescue here and if possible, they should tell all trailer drivers not to move on this road during the day, but at night.</p><p>“Because the trailer drivers that ply this route do not care about human lives at all, they drive their trailers as if they are the only people using this road, and there have been too many deaths at this junction and the government should do something drastic about it.”</p><p>At the time of filing this report, officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) have taken the bodies of the dead victims to a morgue, while the survivors were rushed to the hospital for medical attention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49xZp%2BZpJa5bsDRmqClnaJirqSvyJ2cp6xdmLmitcysZJ%2Bnpad6rbXVnqpmoZ5ir7it0aJkmqqVlnqku9SnmqKkXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
