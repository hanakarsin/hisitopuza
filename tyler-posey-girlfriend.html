No, not ‘I guess,’ I don’t want anyone to take this [interview] and be like: ‘Well, he was kind of wishy-washy about it.’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Prior to his romance with Phem, Tyler was linked to actress Sophia Taylor Ali, who played Dr. Dahlia Qadri on the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy for three seasons, in 2020.
