Convert it today at even N500, how much will it be? What can you show for the money, certainly nothing.”</p><p>However, the spokesman of APC in the state, <strong>Darlington Nwauju,&nbsp;</strong>said on Sunday that Amaechi would not engage the incumbent Governor of Rivers State in a media war.</p><p>Nwauju said it became necessary to set the records straight by confirming that Amaechi has to the credit of his administration, the “Agip, Eliozu Obiri Ikwere, Eleme, and Woji flyover projects”.</p><p>He maintained that the projects, like others under Amaechi’s administration, were done with “Utmost regard for due process as they went through competitive bidding processes with premium standards delivered in the best interest of Rivers people”.</p><h2>APC Is Proud Of Amaechi’s Administration</h2><p>According to him, while the Amaechi administration had an Internally Generated Revenue of between N1.5bn to 1.9bn monthly to work with, the Wike administration is getting between N10bn and N15bn monthly in IGR.</p><p>The APC spokesman boasts that APC was proud that its leader and former Governor, the Minister of Transportation, did so much for Rivers State, including the employment of 13,000 teachers and 400 doctors.</p><p>He further stated that pharmacists and nurses were all employed without clannish, tribal or political sentiments, unlike what he said recently happened at the Rivers State University, where according to him, only persons from Governor Wike’s community were given employment against the Oath of Allegiance sworn-to by the governor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FwZpqlkZqwqbWMsKCknV2jvG64zqeenqpdqa6ssc1mqp6qmaTCtHnBsmSnoZeav6qtzaxkmqiTYrCptcSfq5qhnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
