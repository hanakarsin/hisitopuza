Michael, who is known as the “African King of Comedy,” has been serving up the funny for decades. Michael has starred in films including 2000’s Next Friday, 2018’s Nobody’s Fool, 2021’s Coming 2 America, and more.

In a recent episode of VH1 Couples Retreat, Michael threw a dig at fellow co-star <a href=#>Claudia Jordan</a> without realizing that he could be heard.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On Instagram, Michael shared a clip from the scene, in which Claudia and her boyfriend, KJ, can be seen partaking in a group exercise with the other cast members. In the clip, Claudia shares that she has issues with parenting because KJ is already a father, but he doesn’t seem interested in having children with her. And of course, Michael has something slick to say.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Isn’t she like 48?” Michael whispers to his fiancée Rada as they look on. “Can she have kids, babe?”</p><p>Rada eventually whispers back, "You can still have kids.

Sorry Claudia. I forgot I was mic’d,” Michael’s caption reads with a slew of laughing face emojis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, it appears that Claudia realizes that the joke was said in good fun.</p><p>“Lol you ain’t s--t @michaelblackson ! But you might be right! Ha!!” Claudia commented on Michael’s post.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It’s unclear if Michael and Rada will be interested in having children of their own.
