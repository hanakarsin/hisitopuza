They made that first statement which galvanise the protest that led to the end SARS debate.</p><p>“The Peter Obi movement is a resurgence and emergence of that dissatisfaction.</p><p>“Can Peter Obi ride on the crest and wave Nigeria’s disappointment into the comfortable bowels of the Aso Rock Villa? I say no. I don’t see that.”</p><p>The APC chieftain said the LP will not secure up to 25 percent of votes in 24 states in the 2023 elections, adding that the 2023 presidential election is between two parties.</p><p>Obahiagbon said the election will be keenly contested by the PDP and APC presidential candidates, Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu.</p><p>He said: “Only two major political parties are coming into this election. The two major political parties are the APC and the PDP.</p><p>“But that asseveration notwithstanding, I make bold to assert that even though this election is going to be contested by two major political parties, the election is throwing up three major presidential aspirants.</p><p>“I don’t see how the Labour Party can muster 25 percent in about 24 states in this election.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49tZmtoYmh6uLTYZqeerJWnerCuyKxkqaegqrmivsitsGaho2K0s7vWoqWgZZ6Wwaq7zbCgnZ1dpK%2BitMianpunnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
