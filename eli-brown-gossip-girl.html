Most of the show's details are still being kept secret, but there is some promising news confirmed for diehard fans of the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Eli Brown joins the cast of the 'Gossip Girl' reboot as one of the main trio.</h2><p>Apparently, the Gossip Girl reboot will follow similar formatting to the original series, with a trio of leading characters with others filling out the main cast.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli Brown</a> joins the group as one of Audrey's (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Alyn Lind</a>)'s best friends alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Peak</a>. His character's name and description have yet to be revealed, but Eli is no stranger to teen dramas. Best known Dylan Walker in the PLL spinoff, The Perfectionists and his upcoming role as Brett in The F**k-It List, Eli is bound to fit right into preppy world of Gossip Girl.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>You'll also recognize Emily from Revenge and Doctor Sleep, while Whitney has a role in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.

Other than that, the show will be bringing on an entirely new cast.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Here for the receipts.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Gossip Girl</a> (@gossipgirl) on Feb 13, 2020 at 7:45pm PST</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What else do we know about the reboot?</h2><p>Set eight years after the initial Gossip Girl site shuts down, the streaming service claims this new saga will “introduce a fresh crop of gorgeous Manhattan private-schoolers to Gossip Girl’s all-seeing eye" and "address just how much social media — and the landscape of New York itself — has changed in the intervening years.”</p><p>Joshua also promises that this new reboot will include “a lot of queer content,” telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>, “It is very much dealing with the way the world looks now, where wealth and privilege come from, and how you handle that...
