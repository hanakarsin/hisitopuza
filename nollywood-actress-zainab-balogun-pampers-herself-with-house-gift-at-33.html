I enter my Jesus year with&nbsp; life and testimonies. If he’s not healing me than He’s shocking me with the unthinkable.</p><p class=p1>“A year ago my fav @bolanle bought a property. I watched Him do it and wanted to purchase too but I wasn’t ready by my standards. She had her testimony (a prophecy waiting to happen) and I tapped in. God repeats testimonies. He does it bigger the next time.</p><p class=p1>“A year later my agent luxe.lagos found me the perfect place and the seller randomly gave&nbsp; &nbsp;full possession of the property before it was paid for. I needed a property lawyer for due diligence/paperwork and Holy Spirit led me to @naijapropertylawyer two weeks before I knew I would need her services. I stumbled on her page and admired her passion to educate people on how to get on the property ladder.</p><p class=p1>“Two months after my first property inspection, I secured a tenant via the seller’s agent who moved in within 10 days. The property was still a working site however @booktrueclean came to my rescue with an impeccable clean in less than 24hrs. They turned it around so quick that the tenant was able to move in earlier.</p><p class=p1>“The alignment was ridiculous! Every important request I had was granted. A leap of faith is not a step. It is a giant, ridiculous, impossible jump into the palm of God. There’s so much I want to share on the property investment journey I’ve been on. It wasn’t easy but I’d like to help someone avoid the same mistakes I made.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BpZqennKHGuLvOnWSam6SnsrS%2FjLOYoqaRl3qjrcuonq6mXaWurrzEq6pmoJWnwKa4xWauoqyYYrWwwdKeZKChlql6osCMbGpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
