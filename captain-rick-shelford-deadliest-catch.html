Which is why so many viewers are curious about who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Captain Rick Shelford</a> is on Deadliest Catch and how impressive his own boat, the Aleutian Lady, is in real life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Spoiler alert: just like Rick, the shipping vessel is the real deal. And when it comes to Deadliest Catch, both are in good company as the cast goes on <a href=#>fishing expedition</a>s that are sometimes deadly and not always incredibly profitable. But Rick is a fourth generation Alaskan fisherman and doing what he does is literally in his blood.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Captain Rick Shelford on 'Deadliest Catch'?</h2><p>Rick is a dedicated fishing vessel captain on and off the show. Outside of Deadliest Catch, Rick has been working as a captain for more than a decade. But just because he comes from a long line of fishermen, it doesn't mean Rick's career was just handed to him by any means. In fact, he worked hard and moved through the ranks to get to where he is today.</p><p>According to the official website for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelford Fisheries</a>, Rick started off in 1997 as a green horn, which is someone who works alongside a deckhand and is treated as though they have no fishing experience. He moved up to become an engineer and then captain who is ready and prepared for anything at sea, whether it involves actual fish and crab or the mechanics of a ship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The website says that Rick is "is well-versed in refrigeration, hydraulics, and propulsion systems." And, as viewers see on Deadliest Catch, that's an accurate description of what Rick is capable of.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Captain Rick is in charge of the Aleutian Lady.</h2><p>Rick, along with the Aleutian Lady, are part of Deadliest Catch Season 19. Although the show doesn't always feature a captain and a vessel as an established duo unlikely to split up, that seems to be the case for Rick and the Aleutian Lady. And while it's unclear where the boat is right now, it was last <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tracked</a> in February 2023 at Dutch Harbor in Alaska.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Captain Rick comes from a long line of Alaskan fishermen.</h2><p>Rick comes from a line of Alaskan fisherman and his father owns and runs Shelford Fisheries, which started in 1995. Rick also has a son, Preston, though it's unclear if he, too, will follow in his father's footsteps and join the family business someday. Though that wouldn't be totally out of the ordinary as far as other Deadliest Catch cast members are concerned.</p><p>Either way, Captain Rick takes great pride in his work both on and off the show. And, chances are, fans will grow to love him as much as they're already impressed by the Aleutian Lady.</p><p>Watch Deadliest Catch on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6xwMCipWaqmZi4br%2FHnqOfp6KZeqWxwJ2jop2jqXqkrdOcnw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
