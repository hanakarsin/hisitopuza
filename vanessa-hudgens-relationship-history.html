This was evident in the late 2000s when <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a> and her High School Musical co-star <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> went from movie love interests to real-life lovers (it was a relationship that probably all fans of the movie shipped).</p><p>However, that was just the beginning of their evolving love lives. After splitting up, Zac and Vanessa began dating other people. Fast forward to December 2023, and Vanessa is now officially a married woman! With that said, let's reminisce about her past relationships and delve into the details of her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cole Tucker</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zac Efron: 2005–2010</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As we mentioned before, <a href=#>Zac and Vanessa (Zanessa)</a> were very much a thing. The couple met in 2005 and called it quits in 2010. And apparently, some of their relationship problems unfolded on set. In 2019, Vanessa shared on an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent: Chatter</a> that she and Zac were butting heads during rehearsals.</p><p>"I remember [director] Kenny Ortega coming around the corner with the most concerned look on his face like, 'Oh no, is our movie going to fall apart right now?'" Vanessa explained. "I pride myself on being a professional, so I was like, that aside, we are going to move forward and do what we need to do and we sorted it all out."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Josh Hutcherson: 2011</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Vanessa and <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a> linked up while filming Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.

Josh also teased that Vanessa broke his heart. "That was a while ago, we’re just really good friends now," he confirmed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Austin Butler: 2011–2019</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Vanessa and Austin Butler were <a href=#>first spotted together in 2011</a> and dated for approximately eight years before calling it quits in 2019.
