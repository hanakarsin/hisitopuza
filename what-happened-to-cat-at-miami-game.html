What happened to this furry feline? We have all the details on its harrowing tale (pun intended) below!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The stray cat was saved from a 30-foot fall by fans and staff.</h2><p>During a University of Miami football game where the Hurricanes played against the Appalachian State Mountaineers, fans around the Hard Rock Stadium couldn’t help but turn their eyes away from the game and towards a black-and-white cat that was very close to falling to its death.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cat falls from upper deck of Hard Rock Stadium and is caught in an American flag by fans below at tonight’s Miami Hurricanes-Appalachian State game <a href=#>#BecauseMiami</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FbjsqRT7QJ</a></p>— Billy Corben (@BillyCorben) <a href=#>September 12, 2021</a></figure><p>Ten minutes into the game, the cat fought for survival with its claws as it dangled from a cable. Before long, the feline was holding on with just one claw while fans held their breath. On the deck below where the cat was holding on, a group of fans and a member of the University of Miami staff held out an American flag, attempting to make it work as a sort of net or soft landing space for the cat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A couple attending a football game in Miami used an American flag to rescue a falling cat.</p><p>"It was good to see that the cat was OK, but between the urine and the coke that was spilled on me, I was sticky and stinky," Craig Cromer said. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Gp8YCZiITL</a></p>— New Day (@NewDay) <a href=#>September 13, 2021</a></figure><p>When the cat did in fact fall, the flag softened its landing. A student then grabbed it and held it up to show that it had survived. The crowd went wild.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A staff member and season ticket holder was the brain behind the flag save.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Miami Herald</a> tracked down the man who owned the American flag that ended up saving the now-infamous cat at the football game. Craig Cromer is a facilities manager at the University of Miami. He also has owned Miami Hurricanes season tickets with his wife Kimberly for the past seven years. He told the Herald that the couple hang an American flag over the railing right in front of their seats at every game they attend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CNN</span></figure><p>“Once the Cromers realized what was happening, they sprung into action. Craig ripped his flag free from its zip-ties, and he and his wife stretched it out to create a landing pad for the terrified cat,” the outlet reported. “They stood there for about two or three minutes, Craig estimated, while the cat peed on the fans below.”</p><p>“This is my first catch,” Craig jokingly told The Miami Herald.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watch the dramatic moment a cat falls from the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami and is saved by fans with an American flag <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vhWGj2Ab1g</a></p>— Sun Sport (@SunSport) <a href=#>September 13, 2021</a></figure><p>The home team ended up winning the game, their first win of the season. When asked about the cat in the stands that day, head coach Manny Diaz didn’t know too much about it. “I don’t know anything about that or what was going on,” he said, “but I’ll tell you if the cat can help our red-zone offense, I’ll see if we can get it a scholarship.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The internet went wild with concern over the cat.</h2><p>While a college football game might typically be trending on Twitter because of a massive upset or a huge play, this time, it was because of this cat, which seems to truly have nine lives. One Twitter user wrote, “I literally cannot stop thinking about the Miami cat.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>OK BUT I NEED AN UPDATE ON THE CAT THAT FELL AT THE MIAMI GAME.
