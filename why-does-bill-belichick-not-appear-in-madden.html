He’s also in fan talks for being one of the greatest coaches in the league.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's odd to choose the Patriots in Madden and not see Bill on the sidelines. The reason for his absence actually comes down to a licensing agreement that developer EA Sports has with the NFL Coaches Association.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Bill Belichick not appear in ‘Madden’?</h2><p>The contract between the two parties allows EA Sports to use a coach’s name and simulate their appearance for Madden games. This is why you can see Chiefs’ coach <a href=#>Andy Reid</a> on the sideline during a game or catch play reactions from coach Mike Tomlin if you’re playing with the Steelers. These coaches are part of the NFL Coaches Association, but Bill Belichick is not.</p><p>He’s the only NFL head coach who isn’t a member, which means he hasn’t signed the contract. For many years, Bill has refused to join the association and doesn’t seem interested in EA Sports using his likeness for the games.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Patriots coach has held firm on this decision for decades, but no one knows why. Some fans on Reddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculate</a> that Bill “hates the bureaucracy of the NFL upper management.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another football fan</a> believes his constant rejection is “one of [the] little games he likes to play to show his contempt for the non-football side of the NFL.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since EA Sports couldn’t use Bill as the coach over the Patriots in Madden, the developer decided to make a coach instead. These digital stand-ins — each one named “N.E Coach” — will often get tweaked with every new Madden installment. They can somewhat resemble Bill, but it’s not an entirely 1:1 comparison to skirt around legal issues.</p><p>Judging from his hard stance against the association, players might never see Bill in a Madden game unless he joins the group. However, that’s an unlikely scenario since he has cut off the group for most of his 48 years of coaching.</p><p>You can play Madden NFL ‘24 now on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlkp65rXnBnqOim5iesKx5zairZpmgpbKivoyipWalkZmxpro%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
