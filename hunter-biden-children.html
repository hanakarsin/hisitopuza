He had his three oldest children with Kathleen Buhle, his wife who he married in 1993 and was divorced from in 2017. He later welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, and he also had another daughter with a third woman who he's currently battling in a paternity case.</p><p>Naomi King Biden Neal is Hunter's eldest daughter, and was born in 1993. She was named after Hunter's sister, who died in a car accident along with his mother in 1972. Naomi is reportedly close with Donald Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump, and also lived at the White House after finishing law school. She also celebrated her wedding at the White House in 2022 after marrying her husband Peter Neal.</p><p>Hunter's second oldest daughter is Finnegan Biden, whom he had with Kathleen in 2000. Both Finnegan and Naomi studied at the University of Pennsylvania, but Finnegan has kept a relatively low profile given how famous her family is. She has been active in advocating for change on campus, and also advocated for a change to her school's uniforms when she was in high school.</p><p>Hunter's youngest daughter with Kathleen, Maisy, was born in 2001, and she also studies at UPenn. Maisy is an artist, and the president even attended an art show she had on the university campus. Maisy is active across social media, and currently has more than 150,000 followers on TikTok, where she shares her art, among other things.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NKB (@naomibiden)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@naomibiden</span></figure><p>After divorcing Kathleen, Hunter had a child with Lunden Roberts before marrying his current wife, Melissa. That daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, was born in November 2018. After Navy's birth, there were some doubts about whether the child was actually Hunter's, but following the results of a paternity test, it was determined that Navy was Hunter's, and he was ordered to start paying child support to Lunden. In 2023, Lunden made a contempt filing against Hunter, saying he is not complying with the agreement.</p><p>Hunter welcomed his youngest son Beau in 2020. Beau was named after Hunter's late brother, who died as a result of cancer in 2015. Beau is Hunter's youngest son, and he seems to be spending plenty of time around his grandparents in spite of their busy schedules. Hunter's family has continued to grow in recent years, but it's unclear whether that will continue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncKvwMSrZJuhlJq7bq%2FHoqOdqpWj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
