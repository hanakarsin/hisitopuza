The Duggars are Independent Fundamentalist Baptists, who follow a specific <a href=#>way of living</a> according to the Institute of Basic Life Principles. One important aspect of their religion is not using birth control, which is how we got the series in the first place. <a href=#>Jana Duggar</a> was 18 years old when the show premiered, and now she's all grown up.</p><p>Their specific version of Christianity emphasizes the importance of women being the caretakers and homemakers. As one of the elder children in the Duggar family, Jana, alongside her other sisters, showed how they helped to take care of their younger siblings. Not many people were aware that Jana was in a relationship, so the news of her recent nuptials has fans both surprised and delighted. So, who is Jana's new husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Wissman</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @stephenwissman</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Jana Duggar's new husband, Stephen Wissman?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Jana and Stephen had a quiet wedding in Arkansas on Aug. 15th, 2024. For her fans, this wedding has come out of nowhere, as she never responded to the rumors about her engagement. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Wissman</a> is no stranger to the Duggars and comes from a religious family himself. Stephen is one of 13 children, and his family is already known to the Duggars, as his sister, Hannah Wissman, is married to Jana's brother, <a href=#>Jeremiah Duggar</a>. But that isn't all there is to know about him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @stephenwissman</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Stephen Wissman's family bears a lot of similarities to the Duggars, but there are a few differences as well.</h2><p>Stephen Wissman is a pastor at a Mennonite church in Nebraska. He is one of 13 siblings, so he's obviously no stranger to <a href=#>large family</a> lifestyles. In addition to that, he can play multiple musical instruments and plays in the family band alongside his siblings. With all the similarities in their backgrounds, it makes absolute sense that Jana and Stephen would find a deep connection with each other. People described their wedding as elegant, and the couple looked very happy about their future together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @janamduggar</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was Jill Duggar at Jana's wedding?</h2><p>Jana was walked down the aisle by her father, <a href=#>Jim Bob Duggar</a>, and most of the rest of her family was in attendance. It is unclear whether her sister Jill was there — she has cut ties with many members of the family — but Jill did share her well wishes for the happy couple in an Instagram Story.</p><p>Jana's sister Jessa Duggar Seewald was the matron of honor, and her sister-in-law Abbie Duggar and sisters Joy-Anna Forsyth, Johannah Duggar, Jinger Duggar Vuolo, and Jordyn Duggar were bridesmaids.</p><p>Congratulations to Jana and Stephen!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66vrYydrKCfkad6qcHSm5innA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
