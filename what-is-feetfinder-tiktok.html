And TBH we were never so close to selling feet pics than the time we were trying to get floor seats for <a href=#>Harry Styles Love on Tour</a>.</p><p>We don't feel any type of way admitting this because we know you were also considering this, especially with those <a href=#>FeetFinder TikToks</a> floating around.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you weren't on #feetfinder TikTok and have no idea what we're talking about, let us explain.</p><p>Last spring, a slew of videos popped up of people saying they had made a lot of money by selling their feet on the app, which, you do you — this is a judgement free zone. The problem was that creators didn't make it clear that it was a sponsorship in the video.</p><p>Let's break it down even further...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is FeetFinder real?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Yes! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FeetFinder</a> is a real website! According to them, it's "the safest, easiest, and most secure website for verified users to view, buy, and sell custom feet content [with] over 1,000,000 users uploading and buying content daily."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>FeetFinder works similarly to Only Fans, where buyers can subscribe to creators' channels for a monthly fee, as well as purchase individual videos and photos. Buyers can also filter by feet category, photos, and videos, as well as search with specific keywords.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened with the FeetFinder videos on TikTok?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Last year, a bunch of videos by creators came out on TikTok explaining how people are getting rich on FeetFinder. In the above TikTok posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ayypatrick</a>, Patrick and his girlfriend go to Los Angeles on a private jet so that she could buy a new car. She went with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercedes G63</a>, which retails for $179,000. Patrick then takes us back to his girlfriend's beautiful beach house in Malibu and helps her take some feet pics, explaining that FeetFinder is how she can afford all of this.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Other videos posted had a pretty similar idea, i.e. someone made a lot of money on FeetFinder. This video posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tooturnttony</a> shows how his sister lives in a mansion from her money made on FeetFinder.</p><p>The problem with all of this is that these videos were sponsored by FeetFinder itself, and these sponsorships weren't publicized. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a> reported that, "some creators expressed concern that the ads misrepresented the reality of online sex work, and that the young audiences of those who promoted FeetFinder would be persuaded to pursue it without considering the risks involved."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>FeetFinder's CEO, Patrick Nielson, told NBC News via email that, "We suggested the influencers use hashtags like #ad or #sponsored” at the beginning of the caption... Any influencers that posted a FeetFinder ad without these disclosures were suggested to remove/delete that video ASAP.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just got banned from tiktok because I posted my feetfinder page</p><p>LOL</p>— Dominique Rimas (@dominiquerimas) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></figure><p>Legally, influencers have to disclose any material or financial connection with a brand, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Trade Commission</a>.</p><p>TikTok clearly took this issue very seriously because if you type in "FeetFinder," "#ffsponsorship," "FeetFinder TikTok," or anything similar into the search bar, no results come up. We had to hunt to find the couple of TikToks that weren't taken down.</p><p>And that's the tea! We definitely didn't know we had FeetFinder on our bingo card.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaelZrBp7XNnZyrZaSeuLW7yg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
