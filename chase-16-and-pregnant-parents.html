Rachelle's partner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase Keough</a>, was notably absent from the meet-up.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rachelle's parents expressed doubts about Chase in a recent episode of '16 and Pregnant.'</h2><p>"I do see [Chase] like a good guy. He seems responsible. He likes to work. And that's important," Marvin told<strong> </strong>Rachelle.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"It's not that I don't like him. But I also can't be very [...] for him. I've seen things from him that I don't like. So the only thing I can tell you is [...] always stand up for yourself. And you are the one who has to respect yourself. [...] You are the one who has to love yourself, so that, so that he can respect you," Meryn warned her daughter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As a clip posted on the 16 and Pregnant Instagram page reveals, however, Rachelle stormed off as soon as her parents began to ask more pressing questions.&nbsp;</p><p>During the catch-up, Meryn made clear that she has trouble trusting Rachelle's significant other. However, the 23-year-old star made strong efforts to disprove any doubt about whether he would make a reliable dad. As a recent article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a> notes, he invited Rachelle to move in with him, and he even took on a new job to be able to provide for her and their daughter, Boston.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>ðŸ–¤</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by @<a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px> ru.shell</a> on Dec 24, 2017 at 10:41pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chase's parents have yet to make an appearance on '16 and Pregnant.'</h2><p>Unfortunately, not much is known about Chase's family at present. Although he frequently takes it to Instagram to share adorable photographs of Rachelle and their newborn, Boston, he has only posted about his dad, Doug, once.&nbsp;</p><p>As a photograph shared on March 30, 2020, reveals, Chase has already introduced his first-born daughter to his dad, aka "Grandpa Doug." The beautiful photo shows his old man firmly holding onto a slightly sleepy-looking Boston.&nbsp;</p><p>As another Instagram post reveals, Chase has at least one brother. It's uncertain whether he would be interested in following<strong> </strong>Iris's, Rachelle's sister's lead, and feature on 16 and Pregnant as well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Unlike previous seasons of the ever-popular reality TV show, the rebooted version of 16 and Pregnant tilts the perspective to offer in-depth insight into how pregnancy affects young women and those in their situation. Family, friends, romantic partners, and others will get the chance to provide details about how the arrival of a newborn has changed their lives via video confessionals.&nbsp;</p><p>The new configuration allows viewers to learn more about the people who are close with stars like Rachelle,<strong> </strong>Camryn Fields, or<strong> </strong>Kasmonyae Harris. Unfortunately, it's uncertain whether Chase's folks will get the chance to lay claim to more airtime and feature on 16 and Pregnant in the future as well.</p><p>Catch new episodes of 16 and Pregnant every Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiv8RmaG9lkaOxbrzRnp6nmZ6perGt0Z6lras%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
