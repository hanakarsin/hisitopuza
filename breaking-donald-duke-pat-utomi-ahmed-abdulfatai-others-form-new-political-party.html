Nkoyo Toyo, Yomi Awoniyi, Dr. Rose Idi Danladi, Dr. Sadiq Gombe among others.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Usman Bugaje was appointed as the coordinator of the RNP.</p><p>Speaking at the unveiling, former Kwara Governor, Abdulfatai lamented the state of the nation.</p><p>He stated that the high level of nepotism and lack of inclusiveness have given rise to agitations by different ethnic groups.</p><p>The former governor recalled that in 2015, Nigerians embraced change, adding that today, “that change appears to be what we didn’t expect, as insecurity has taken over the nation.”</p><p>He said, “It is based on this that we decided to set up this Rescue Nigeria Project. We want to salvage this country and see how we can fix the mess. We want to set a template and key criteria leaders must have before they can attain any political position.</p><p>“Despite the great opportunities of the past, Nigeria has failed to live up to the dreams of its founding fathers and the hopes of successive generations of its citizens.</p><p>“Perhaps, at no other time have these failings become more apparent than in the past decade or so.”</p><p>On his part, Tunde Adeniran stated that the nation is currently experiencing a disaster, hence the need to rescue her.</p><p>He said: “You only rescue when there is disaster and when you fail to rescue during disaster, it is more dangerous.</p><p>“We have a disaster in our hands and we need to rescue the country. We need to look back and see how we get here. We know where Nigeria was before now. We know the task is not going to be easy, but we have to determine how to rescue the nation.”</p><p>The RNP national coordinator, Usman Bugaje, in his opening remark, slammed the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.</p><p>Bugaje said, “when you reduce the problems of this country to what they are, ultimately, it all comes to leadership.</p><p>“We have been unable to exit the leadership conundrum precisely because the leadership recruitment mechanism in our political parties is so flawed that, except for accidents, they are incapable of producing competent leaders with the requisite knowledge, discipline and commitment to make a difference. We are living with, or better still, groaning under the consequences of this folly.</p><p>“What this means is that any attempt to rescue this country from its troubles must first rescue it from the current leadership recruitment mechanism that seems to leverage on money and connection or ethnic sentiments and no premium on knowledge or competence.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FqZpuqlZa4qrrGZpuoppGhsW6w1KScZqiRqXq2wM6moGaZmKKypXnAm5uupJaWwaK1jKiroZ2iqHqnu9GmZKedp2K9sLjIraCcmZxivaK%2B07Jm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
