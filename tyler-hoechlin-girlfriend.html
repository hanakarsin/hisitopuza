Does he have a girlfriend? We have all the details on his love life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The highly anticipated CW series <a href=#>Superman & Lois</a> is set to premiere in February 2021. Leading man <a href=#>Tyler Hoechlin</a> will play the title role and legendary superhero, Superman. In the new take on Superman, he and Lois Lane are struggling to figure out how to be working parents while also working on saving the world again and again.&nbsp;</p><p>Actress Elizabeth Tulloch plays Tyler’s on-screen wife as Lois Lane, but who is the actor seeing in real life? Does he have a girlfriend? We have all the details below!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tyler Hoechlin has been linked to several Hollywood actresses.</h2><p>Though the media has linked Tyler to many actresses like Brittany Snow, one of his first relationships was with singer Ashlee Simpson. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, he was also linked to The Vampire Diaries star Candice Accola King before dating Glee dancer Rachele Brooke Smith in 2010. The couple dated from 2010 until 2012.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I've been with my girlfriend for two years. You have to not be afraid to do the little things. You can always send flowers or something like that. My girlfriend and I never let each other forget how much we love each other. It's all about reminding the other person how important and special she is to you," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a> in 2010.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tyler was also rumored to be hooking up casually with a costar.</h2><p>After Tyler and Rachele called it quits, he was rumored to be in a relationship with his Teen Wolf costar, Jill Wagner. Fans of the series were convinced that Jill was the woman behind Tyler’s anecdote about the best date he’s ever been on that he shared to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a> in 2013. "It was not like a long-term, we're-in-a-relationship thing. Just two days in Hawaii to relax and enjoy the beach. It was incredible," he revealed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><p>As of 2021, it seems that Tyler is living the single life. That doesn’t mean, however, that he’s not having fun. He mentioned that he has no issues with kissing his friends. “I would never go against having a friend to kiss. If it’s there, go for it, but don’t force it … There’s nothing better that you could be doing than what you’re doing and who you’re with, so have a hell of a time, have a drink, and have fun,” he said to Cosmo.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tyler mentioned that his role as Clark Kent and Superman is a relationship in itself.</h2><p>While Clark Kent and Lois Lane have always been a dynamic pair, there is the question of where Superman fits into his marriage. In a one-on-one interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, Tyler explained that Lois’ role in Clark Kent’s life is crucial for Superman’s survival.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tyler Hoechlin (@tylerhoechlin)</a></p></figure><p>“Lois, being the closest person to him in life, knows who [Superman] is and is also aware of when he’s playing the other parts. It’s not so much that there’s a third person there. It’s just, for them, it’s his job. It’s his calling. It’s what he has to do. It’s not so much a third person, as it is an obligation that he feels he owes for what he can do. It’s a demanding job,” he explained.</p><p>Superman & Lois airs on the CW, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqcatsdFmn6idk525qrqMoKCrpJantqa6ww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
