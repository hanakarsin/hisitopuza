Dear Nigerians, this is not about the North or South here. We are no longer interested in party politics but in the qualities of the candidate!

Me and his children have lived together and shared the same bed. When I did not have anywhere to go, he took me in. He has also taken care of me to an extent. That is the true definition of family. I know him very well and I believe he means well to the youth. I also think he is the best presidential candidate. I was attacked after I made that tweet (about Atiku being my father), and I wondered why.”</p><p>It will be recalled that Okonkwo and some former BBN housemates, including Bright Osemudiame, aka Brighto, and Chukwuemeka Okoye, aka Frodd; and popular skit maker, Promise Anagbogu, aka Lord Lamba, recently met with Atiku.

He is a focused leader, a leader of all leaders.”</p><p>“He has personally developed many people in our industry, especially those that had health challenges. For example, when actress, Moji Olaiya, died in Canada, he was responsible for everything that had to do with transporting her body back home,” Kosoko added.</p><p>He furthered that the film industry has enjoyed Tinubu, as he was the first person to give the industry several hectares of land in Badagry to construct a film village. “The succeeding administration gave us reasons the place was not conducive enough, and immediately, an effort was made to give us another place in Epe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49xZmtoYmh6prjEnKuip55isKa4xJupoqyZmsBuvMitmqFlpJq7tXnWoquhZaCnsqex0aucnWWgp7K0tcOepa2hkaF6pK3NnaCdmaSawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
