The basis of his lawsuit revolves around the alleged infringement of his rights. Kanu claims that he was unlawfully taken from Kenya and forcibly returned to Nigeria for the purpose of facing trial.</p><p>Kanu is seeking the court’s intervention to ascertain whether the manner in which he was abducted in Kenya and subsequently transported to Nigeria aligns with the existing laws and regulations.</p><p>Particularly, he cited “the provisions of Article 12 (4) of the African Charter on human and peoples rights (ratification and enforcement) Act Cap A9 laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Article/Part 5 (a) of the African Charter’s principles and guidelines on human and peoples’ rights while countering terrorism in Africa.”</p><p>Kanu is also requesting the court to determine whether he can be legally tried for the offences stated in counts 1 to 14 of the 15-count amended charge. He argues that these counts do not align with the offences for which he was brought to Nigeria.</p><p>In his legal petition, the leader of IPOB is seeking various reliefs, including his release from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS). He is also seeking an order to prevent the defendants from proceeding with the prosecution of criminal charge no: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015, which is currently being heard by Justice Binta Nyako in a sister court.</p><p>Furthermore, Kanu is requesting the court to award him the sum of N100 million as compensation for the expenses incurred in pursuing this legal action.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal government and the Attorney General of the Federation had in a notice of preliminary objection dated Jun 6, 2022, but filed June 27, 2022, prayed the court to dismiss the suit, describing it as “an abuse of court process.”</p><p>The defendants put forth a single argument, contending that Kanu had previously filed a lawsuit with identical facts in a Federal High Court, Umuahia Division.</p><p>Additionally, they asserted that both defendants were involved in that particular lawsuit.</p><p>As per the defendants’ perspective, this renders the current lawsuit an abuse of the court process, thereby depriving the court of its jurisdiction to hear the present case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FyZqOto6l6qrqMnKauqqRirqW2zq6pp6tdo7uiucOiZKSZnqrAbrqUaWSboZyhtrC6jKysoqxdlrSitc2sq2ael2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
