She said, "When he and I ever started, like, hooking up or, like, anything of that sort, he was not ever in a relationship, ever at any point... It‚Äôs not my character to mess with someone‚Äôs relationship. I would just never do that.‚Äù</p><p>As the same report noted, Selena appeared to respond to the hate Hailey had experienced during her own TikTok live a few days after Hailey's appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast.</p><p>Selena said, "It‚Äôs not fair, because no one should ever be spoken to in the manner that I‚Äôve seen." She reminded her fans that supported her Rare beauty collection that, "Words matter. Truly matter."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images</span><p>It's like Haley knows she's going to break the internet that night.</p></figure><p>So, does the now iconic Hailey and Selena photo show the start of a beautiful friendship? Have they been besties all along? Not necessarily. But they aren't standing for unwarranted hate against each other and we love to see it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wait, why did people hate Hailey in the first place? An explainer.</h2><p>If you're new to the Hailey and Selena drama, we'll fill you in real quick. Basically, Selena and Justin had an on and off again relationship that would rival Ross and Rachel's from 2011 to 2018. The couple called it quits for good in March 2018, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a>.</p><p>Justin rekindled things with Hailey after he and Selena split, and ended up proposing to Hailey in July 2018. The couple tied the knot in September 2018. (Cue the homewrecker allegations that Hailey denied during her interview).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez at the 2nd Annual Academy Museum Gala in LA. üì∏ Tyrell Hampton <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DkBG7R7y3J</a></p>‚Äî Hailey Bieber Outfits (@haileysoutfits) <a href=#>October 16, 2022</a></figure><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a> that "Selena and Hailey were both super chill together at the Academy Museum Gala.
