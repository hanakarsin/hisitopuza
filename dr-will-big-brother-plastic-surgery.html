Over the years, he has also appeared on Battle of the Network Reality Stars, Dr. 90210, The Doctors, and The Real Housewives of Orange County. He played himself in a 2006 episode of The Young and the Restless, and he even won a 2016 episode of The Price Is Right.</p><p>He recently told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Us Weekly</u></a> that his reality competition days are over and that he’s focusing on the cutthroat world of dermatology. “Dermatologists are even more competitive than Big Brother houseguests!” he quipped. “Scheming and more petty too. Oh, and don’t even get me started on how jealous they are! Also, the stakes are a lot higher in dermatology.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He added, "But whether it’s on television or a clinic, the cream always rises to the top. Bottom line: Dermatology isn’t a competition but, rest assured, LaserAway is winning.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What’s Dr. Will doing on ‘Big Brother: All-Stars’?</h2><p>In the Sept. 24 episode of <a href=#><u>Big Brother 22</u></a>, the latest All-Stars season, a bathrobe-clad Dr. Will greeted the houseguests to tease the upcoming triple eviction.</p><p>“For the next [Head of Household] competition and Veto competition, you’re going to have an important decision to make, go for power or go for prizes,” he said. “I sure know what I would do. Good luck. I do live right next door, so you will be seeing me again.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He elaborated on his involvement in the Us interview, saying, “The ‘neighbor’ kicks off one of the greatest weeks in the history of Big Brother. Immense powers and opulent prizes are at stake. Plus, it’s capped off by the first ever triple eviction. This will be a defining moment for the series!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Dr. Will get plastic surgery?</h2><p>While Dr. Will’s Big Brother appearance took a lot of fans by surprise, others were more fixated by his physical appearance. “Did he perform his own plastic surgery?” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked</u></a> one Twitter user. “Why does he look like Jude Law-as-a-robot in A.I.?” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> another. And a third user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>, “The real surprise was how plastic he looked.”</p><p>(Some users rose to his defense, however. “I don’t know why people are complaining. Will looks HOT,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> one fan.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Anyway, amid all this hubbub about Dr. Will’s “neighbor” role, would he ever consider joining Big Brother as a houseguest again? “In the interest of full candor, it would just have to be just the perfect situation,” he told Us. “So, as it stands right now today, I’m officially retired from competitive reality television programming and I’ll just continue to focus my efforts on the aesthetic dermatology world. Will I ever come out of reality retirement? Stay tuned.”</p><p>Although it's difficult to say for sure whether Dr. Will has had plastic surgery — considering he hasn't spoken publicly on the topic — it wouldn't be that shocking if he did. Who knows? Maybe he'll open up about potentially going under the knife if he really does make a reality TV comeback.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb9uw8ilo2aamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql2luaK%2F06KaZqulp7Smvtg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
