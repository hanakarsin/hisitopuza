The deceased officer Ukam Efut and two others were at a certain checking point, as usual, where they mounted a roadblock and were collecting money from illegal oil dealers (bunkering).</p><p>“Mr Ukam, the deceased officer, was shot dead and his p*nis cut off by his killers and made away with the p*nis. One of the other two officers sustained wounds on his face.</p><p>“We call the place he was shot dead Okpo-efi junction, Agwa Ejemekwuru road. The development was really unfortunate as they made away with the man’s private part. The community is quiet now.”</p><p>Chairman of the community, Ekene Onyejiekwe said the body of the victim has been deposited in a morgue in Owerri.</p><p>Onyejiekwe said; “He was shot by unknown gunmen. I received a distress call from the DCO of the police headquarters that a group of policemen had been attacked in the community.</p><p>“Before then, some of my people coming back from the farm told me about the incident first. The DCO asked me to assist in evacuating the slain cop. On arrival at the scene of the incident, I saw the DPO, DCO and the Area Commander. The Area Commander instructed that the remains of the fallen police officer be taken to the morgue.</p><p>“Members of the community and security operatives took the body to the morgue in Owerri. That is all I can tell you about the incident.”</p><p>A police source told the publication that the officer was newly posted to the area and he had two years to his retirement.</p><p>The source said; “It is not more than two weeks he was transferred from Abia State to the area. He was the administrative officer and had two years to his retirement before he was murdered. It is really painful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49tZqCtnqKyr3nMrqmdnaJivbC4yJycZqeWm7aksdFmmK1lk52ypLfPqKCnrF2YwrV5zp%2BdZqCZqHqurc2hpqicXZa7pXnFpZyeZaeewal5yK1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
