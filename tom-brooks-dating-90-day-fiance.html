The sweet proposal took place in London, with Tom spontaneously getting down on one knee after his original plan to pop the question in Venice in front of her sons didn't materialize.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the couple is in a long-distance relationship, with Mariah residing in Las Vegas with her two sons and Tom living in England. Now, as the pair embark on the next chapter of their relationship, important discussions lie ahead, including the decision on their future living arrangements.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mariah (@ladym_tv)</a></p></figure><p>"I'm so happy that myself and Mariah are engaged, but we still need to decide where we are going to live," he says in the episode, adding, "But in the meantime, I'll be traveling to Turkey to get my teeth fixed."</p><p>Tom soon confesses to Mariah that he's tired of living apart, and she suggests he consider moving to Las Vegas to be with her and her sons. However, the Londoner reveals he feels like an outsider during his visits to Vegas, even staying in a separate house. Nevertheless, Mariah assures him that things will be different now that they're engaged.</p><p>"Now that Mariah has assured me that living in the U.S. will be different than last time I stayed there, I feel a bit better about moving to the U.S. and building our lives there together but I have a lot to consider," he tells producers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mariah (@ladym_tv)</a></p></figure><p>Later in the episode, Tom visits his mother, Jayne, who's in poor health.
