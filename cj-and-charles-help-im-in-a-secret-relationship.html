I'm in a Secret Relationship!' Shares Doubts (EXCLUSIVE CLIP)</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Chrissy Bobic</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published March 21 2023, 10:00 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>The premise behind MTV's <a href=#>Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship</a> is all about the idea that one of the participants in any given episode feels as though they are being kept hidden from their partner's life. And in many cases, their suspicions prove to be true.</p><p>In an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the March 21 episode of Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship!, we learn about CJ and Charles, their relationship, and CJ's friend, who has some serious concerns.</p><p>She shares with <a href=#>hosts</a> Travis Mills and Rahne Jones why she thinks Charles is cheating on her friend, CJ, and why she thinks Charles is keeping CJ a secret from other people in his life. Sometimes, the show helps bring the truth to light and aids couples in taking necessary steps forward. But if what CJ's friend is saying is true, then CJ and Charles may not have a future after this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span><p>CJ's friend is worried about him on 'Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship!'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are CJ and Charles on 'Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship!'?</h2><p>Charles and CJ's episode of Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship! is a special case. While CJ's friend believes he is being kept secret from other people in Charles's life, the couple is plenty public with aspects of their relationship. And, prior to going on the show, Charles and CJ had been together for almost 10 years. In many ways, their relationship is solid.</p><p>But CJ has concerns about feeling like he's kept hidden and in the Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship! clip, his friend expresses the same worries. CJ is younger than Charles, which could be a reason why CJ's friend is so certain that there's something wrong in the relationship. Because, according to her, it could be as serious as infidelity.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>She explains an instance where she and CJ went out one evening and Charles dropped them off. But when Charles drove away, he stopped and spoke to some people on the street. And the incident didn't sit well with her.</p><p>"I notice Charles drive past the traffic light and stop," she says in the clip. "Where he stopped at, [there] was this group of people. One person from the group walked over to the passenger side of Charles's carâ€¦ I finished chatting it up with my friend, looked back over, [and] Charles drove off. I believe that Charles is cheating on CJ."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">CJ's friend thinks Charles is cheating.</h2><p>If that behavior isn't enough to convince CJ's friend that Charles is being unfaithful, there was a late night exchange of money between Charles and someone by the name of Sam that also caught her eye. CJ's friend explains to Rahne and Travis that she saw a payment to Charles on a payment app with a kissing face emoji.</p><p>Travis agrees that, because someone by the name of Sam also left the same emoji on one of Charles's social media accounts, it seems suspicious and "feels flirtatious." And all three of them are ready to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>Watch Help! I'm in a Secret Relationship! on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLdurc2dZJygkae5pr%2BMoZylqF2eum61zWaYZquVmL%2BmwIyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
