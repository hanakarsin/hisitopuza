In 2016, his comedy special One Shot premiered on Netflix. A known collaborator of <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a> and specialist in so-called "insult comedy," Tony has officially gone too far after he used a racial slur about fellow comedian Peng Dang.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After footage of the comedy set was posted to Twitter, people have been wondering if Tony's wife is still in the picture, especially since he's been let go from his talent agency and other professional support systems. Read on to find out everything we know about Tony's wife and his racist outburst.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Initially, people thought Tony's wife was a running gag in his comedy sets.</h2><p>Tony first mentioned he was married in 2015, during a set in which his audience did not believe him. In 2017, he announced that he would be marrying Charlotte Jane and posted a photo of them together with an engagement ring to Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Even after this second announcement, most people thought he was kidding, until a another Instagram post emerged that read, "Married as f--k. Honeymooning in La Jolla performing 4 shows this weekend at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@comedystorelj</a>....then Australia Nov. 22-27. Tix at TONYHINCHCLIFFE.COM." Tony then referred to Charlotte as "his wife" at various shows in 2018, confirming the news was not a hoax and actually real.</p><p>Tony's wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Jane</a>, is the daughter of Australian race car driver and entrepreneur Bob Jane. Her occupation is unlisted, but she appears to be a pin-up model and Instagram influencer. While she and Tony haven't been posting very often about one another,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a post from May 1</a>&nbsp;indicates that Tony is still "who [she] fell in love with."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tony spewed racist comments during a comedy set in Austin, Texas.</h2><p>Comedian Peng Deng, who performed a set before Tony,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a clip of the set to Twitter</a>&nbsp;on May 11, 2021, with the caption, "Last week in Austin, I got to bring up Tony Hinchcliffe. This is what he said. Happy Asian (AAPI) Heritage Month!" The video shows Tony taking the stage and appallingly saying, "How about one more time for the filthy little fucking c***k that was just up here."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Tony doubles down on his racist comments, despite his first sentence not having a punchline. "All you f----g race traitors are hooping and hollering. I was back there watching you puking in a f----g bucket." Tony then adds an offensive accent and says, "Oh we make gunpowder. Oh you want extra soy sauce. Oh you borrow money from us! And you guys are just eating it up, you f----g p----s."&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the news broke of his repulsive "jokes," TMZ reported that Tony&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had been dropped by his talent agency</a>,&nbsp;WME. Despite this, he has shows scheduled in Wisconsin and a weekly podcast, but people hope Tony will address his comments and retract them. Jokes are supposed to be funny, and using racial slurs is never funny â€” just hateful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyvxYyhoKebmJi5qrLFnmSwoZaa</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
