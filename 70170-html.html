As I speak to you now, am on my way to Saudi Arabia for the laser hajj, so nothing happened to me and my convoy. I'm safe and call on our people to continue to pray against the perpetrators of this devil act.”</i></p><p>This is <strong><a href=#>not the first time Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi is targeted by terrorists</a></strong>. In the evening of July 1, 2014, a bomb went off around the Asikolaye/Bakin Ruwa along Nnamdi Azikwe expressway.
