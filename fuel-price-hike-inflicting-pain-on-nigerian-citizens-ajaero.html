So who are the losers?” he asked.</p><p>These happenings, Ajaero said, “are a situation of public disaster and private gain.”</p><p>He stated, “We are living in a prodigal economy, and 99 percent, if not 100 percent of privatised companies in Nigeria have failed.”</p><p>Ajaero, who noted that the country has been on an increasing debt journey, queried, “Who do you think will pay it?</p><p>“I know they tell you that you have to suffer a bit so you can gain, but it has been the same story since forever.”</p><p>He concluded by expressing concern over the closure of companies and the escalating unemployment rates in the country, “so we need policies to keep people in their jobs and not the other way around.”</p><p>After his election, President Bola Tinubu announced the removal of the fuel subsidy, emphasizing that it was unsustainable for the country.</p><p>He further explained that the trillions of naira annually allocated to sustain the subsidy could be redirected to enhance sectors such as healthcare, transportation, education, housing, and national security.</p><p>Tinubu argued that the funds were currently being diverted into the extravagant bank accounts of a privileged few.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FuZp%2BtlaF6sb7InJxmoJmgsm61zZ%2Bjopuknruoec%2BaoKdln6N6r7XGnqmimZ5isKrAyLOcp6tdlreisdGoZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
