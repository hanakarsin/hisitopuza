This is because he’s so important to every one of us.</p><p>“What we are trying to do in our party, we know he is not partisan, we know he is an elder statesman par excellence, but we are rebuilding our party, the rancour, we still need him. His voice of wisdom is always very useful. So, I came to sound his opinion on some of the things we want to do in the party and to make sure that we provide Nigeria with the opportunity to rescue Nigeria from the present rancour and division that we have found ourselves in. These are the two main reasons why I came to see him.”</p><p>Mohammed when asked about his chances of winning PDP’s ticket said, “I’m very optimistic. To me, the presidency is a consensus… Of course, every Nigeria should if they can contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation, especially now that leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure we bring everybody on board to reduce the spate or manifestation of separatism, feelings of disillusionment and disgruntlement, feelings that are capable of dividing us further.</p><p>“Nigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my aspirations. It is about the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FsZmtoYmh6pbHTmqClq12ks26uwKWYZqWfna6uucSdqmallZrBqrrGZq6irJhivKOt0pqlo6ddmrqmvsaeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
