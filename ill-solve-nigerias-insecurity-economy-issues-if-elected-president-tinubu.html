Look at Lagos now, it generates over N40 billion in revenue.</p><p>“Division is one of the problems in Nigeria too but there is no division in Lagos because any tribe or religion is welcomed as they can contest and win elections. That is why Lagos is thriving.</p><p>“Nigeria has the potential to compete with Russia in oil and gas exploration. If we harness our resources properly and if there is stable electricity, Nigeria will also compete with other nations in manufacturing.</p><p>“I am here to seek the blessing of our royal fathers for my presidential ambition because I know where the problems are and if given the opportunity in 2023, Nigeria will be ranked among the best nations in the world. I am imploring all eligible voters to get their Permanent Voters Card revalidated for them to exercise their civic responsibilities.”</p><p>In his remarks, the Deji of Akure backed the presidential ambition of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>The monarch described Tinubu as the right candidate for the 2023 presidency, adding that he has the ability to solve the country’s problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49uZqKknGLAsLjVnmSnoZeav6qt0magp6uVmMKztdOyZJ6bn6O8rsWMoqqsrZWoeqqyjJ6jnpukmrFuvNGeqqKclaPBbsDIp6ybrV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
