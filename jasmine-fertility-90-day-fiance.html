And it doesn't take long in Season 8 of <a href=#>90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?</a>, for the couple to be, once again, no longer on the same page. The biggest thing they have on their plate as newlyweds is expanding their family. However, Jasmine worries her past fertility issues could cause complications in having a baby with Gino. Although Gino is more optimistic about it, Jasmine can't help but worry.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jasmine had fertility issues with a past pregnancy before '90 Day Fianc√©.'</h2><p>In the March 24 episode of 90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?, Jasmine reveals to Gino that she had trouble getting pregnant with her son, JC. Although this is news to Gino, he takes it in stride and tries to assure Jasmine that they won't have trouble having a baby together. Still, Jasmine is worried about ovulation and, according to her, it's important to take advantage of her ovulation window more than once per day.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"I'm not the most fertile person in the world," Jasmine explains in the episode. She adds that it was "very hard" to conceive son JC. She explains, "I even had to go through hormonal treatment to get pregnant."</p><p>Gino is surprised to hear this, but he tells Jasmine that a pregnancy will happen for her easily enough. She isn't convinced, though.</p><p>"I always knew from the very beginning of our relationship that Gino wanted to have kids," Jasmine tells producers. "But I was afraid of letting him know that, hey, I struggled with fertility before. The whole thing was very hard on my relationship with my ex. That's why I'm scared that it will affect also my relationship with Gino. But now that we're trying to have a baby, I need to be 100 percent honest."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gino and Jasmine wanting a kid together is insane. A baby alone is not easy, especially with a child with special needs and another child. <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a> <a href=#>#90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter</a> <a href=#>#HappilyEverAfter</a></p>‚Äî üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (@soIarsavy) <a href=#>March 25, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gino wants to have a baby with Jasmine as soon as possible.</h2><p>Jasmine says that she had to have "daily injections" in order to "sustain" her pregnancy with one of her sons. It's unclear if Jasmine had fertility problems with both of her children from her previous relationship. However, it's something she can't help but worry about now. Regardless, Gino is determined to have a baby with Jasmine.</p><p>For Jasmine, having a family with Gino also means getting her two sons over to the United States to live with them. For now, her sons are being cared for by Jasmine's mom and sister, and although Gino promised that he would make it possible for Jasmine's kids to join her in the U.S., they're facing some major red tape and a $5,000 price tag for legal fees to make it all possible.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jasmine doesn't want to have a baby with Gino anymore.</h2><p>Outside of 90 Day Fianc√©, Jasmine hasn't shared if she is pregnant yet. Gino has made it clear that he plans to care for Jasmine's sons like they're his own. However, as of now, the kids haven't been on the various shows in the franchise very much. And in the preview that aired after the May 5 episode, Jasmine reveals that she secretly doesn't want to have a baby with Gino anymore. The drama continues for these two.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After? on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660ucinnGaelafBqrjIrbBmcWBisaLFjJ%2BgmqaTmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
