We've got the answers for you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Terry is a football Hall of Famer.</h2><p>In 1989, Terry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Before that, he led the Steelers to Super Bowl victories in 1975, 1976, 1979, and 1980. In addition to four Super Bowl wins, Terry also won the Super Bowl MVP award twice! Why did Terry choose to retire in 1983 after his epic success as a quarterback? Terry chose to retire as a football player partially due to a painful elbow injury he sustained during training camp.</p><p>You'll never see Terry's Super Bowl rings at the Bradshaw family home in The Bradshaw Bunch. Terry actually donated his Super Bowl rings (and other various football related awards he had won) to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech. Terry began his football career at Louisiana Tech. According to Terry's official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> page, Terry was considered to be the best college football player in the nation in 1969.
