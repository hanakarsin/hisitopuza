Another photo showed some of the hospital’s staff, including Elizabeth (Sandra Mae Frank), Lauren (Janet Montgomery), and Casey (Alejandro Hernández), giving someone a standing ovation. The grand gesture could signify that someone in the finale will receive their flowers before the show ends.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Thankfully, fans will see the moments leading up to the photos less than two months after the <a href=#>show’s fall finale</a>.

Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max battled cancer</a> throughout the show’s run, New Amsterdam showrunner David Schulner didn’t want his disease to be the end of his story. After throwing some shade at ER’s choice to kill Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), he confirmed that Max <a href=#>wouldn’t die in the series finale</a>.</p><p>“Hopefully, our legacy will be that there’s hope for a better medical system, so I think killing Max would not be a great way to go out,” David told TVLine. “There are a lot of twists and turns in the finale … a lot of reveals and reversals. You’re not going to know where it lands until the very final moment of the episode.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Eggold (@ryaneggold)</a></p></figure><p><a href=#>Ryan</a>, who has played Max for five consecutive seasons, has shared his own thoughts about the series coming to an end.
