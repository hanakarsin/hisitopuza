But now the NCAA has confirmed that the allegations are true and that on at least one occasion, Connor dressed in a disguise to gain access to the sidelines of another college football team.</p><p>The scandal is significant not only because this behavior is of course prohibited, but since the <a href=#>Wolverines</a> won the national championship in 2024, whether that victory will stand is in question.

Stalions was wearing a bench pass, Central Michigan coaching gear, and a disguise, according to the draft, which states that Stalions' conduct seriously undermined or threatened the integrity of the NCAA collegiate model."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well, well, well…</p><p>Is that Connor Stalions wearing CMU gear, on the CMU sidelines as they opened their season up against Michigan State? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Bxl8Bzeail</a></p>— AthletesInSpace (@AthletesInSpace) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans and some members of the media are calling for Michigan's victory to be vacated.</h2><p>In addition to many angry fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barstool Sports</a> is claiming that it's a no-brainer that Michigan's championship title should be vacated in light of the scandal surrounding Connor, saying in part, "The idea that you'd have a coach on the sidelines of one of your opponents is flat out disgusting. Ruins the integrity of the game and of the conference."</p><p>The scandal is further complicated by the fact that head coach Jim Harbaugh left the college football dynasty and moved on to coach NFL team the <a href=#>Los Angeles Chargers</a>.</p><p>Some critics say he hightailed it out of Wolverine territory to avoid being linked to the Connor drama. Others even allege he knew what was going on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dave, it’s obvious, stalions was more than a volunteer, the olayers were complicit, harbaugh can deny all he wants…</p><p>Aidan Hutchinson knew this was a screenplay before the snap <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/H09aXusNM9</a></p>— Chugs (@ChugDeezNutz) <a href=#>November 3, 2023</a></figure><p>Ultimately, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>, Connor is going to take fans inside his account of what happened in a new <a href=#>Netflix episode of Untold</a>.
