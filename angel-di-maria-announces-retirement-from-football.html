I cannot express in words how much the applause from the people in this recent time fills my soul.</p><p>“I enjoy every second of that affection and the love from my teammates. They, my friends, without them, this story wouldn’t have the same meaning. The affection from each of them also made me who I am today.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we cannot overlook the events that occurred in the stadium. No one deserves that mistreatment, neither the blows nor families and frightened children in the midst of a stadium where the only thing that should have happened is watching and enjoying a match within the folklore of football.</p><p>“Hopefully, these kinds of things won’t happen again. As players, we will always, always defend our people without a doubt.</p><p>“The Copa América will be the last time I wear the Argentine jersey. With a heavy heart and a lump in my throat, I bid farewell to the most beautiful thing that happened to me in my career: wearing it, sweating it, and FEELING it with all the pride.</p><p>“Thanks to the fans, thanks to my family, thanks to friends and teammates from the national team. We continue making history, and that will remain for all eternity. Vamos Argentina carajo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FsZpqml5q5brDIZqSaqpmWeqK6zaisp5uVqHqzsdOiqZ6llaPBbrLRqKRmnp%2BkwaOty6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
