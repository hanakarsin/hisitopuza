Young people are trying so hard to make a name for themselves that the content pushed out by these creators has to be more engaging and outrageous than the last. Clickbait and misleading video thumbnails are a norm for platforms like YouTube, where views and subscribers can lead to money and sponsorships for popular content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>So when TikTok and YouTube personality <a href=#>Cody Orlove</a> uploaded a video to his YouTube channel where he seems to marry his girlfriend, <a href=#>Zoe LaVerne</a>, the couple's fans couldn‚Äôt help but be a bit suspicious.&nbsp;Is the marriage real? Or just for clicks?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Cody Orlove and Zoe LaVerne actually get married?</h2><p>The YouTube video titled, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúWE GOT MARRIED! **Cody & Zoe's Official Wedding Video**</a>‚Äù, contains slow-motion shots of a groom putting on a tux, bridesmaids reacting to the beauty of the bride, and pretty much an entire wedding. While all this goes on, a voiceover of the bride and groom‚Äôs vows plays in the background. All of this would lead one to think that these two teens actually went ahead and got hitched - but there‚Äôs one caveat: it was for 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Cody recites his vows and says, ‚ÄúToday is the day - the day where I get to marry my best friend. I always knew and hoped this day would come. It‚Äôs been a long three years and with that came laughter, love, excitement, and thrill and now it‚Äôs officially here and I‚Äôm nervous and I even have butterflies in my stomach. But it was all worth it because I get to marry this beautiful, amazing, talented, hilarious girl that is mine and now is mine for 24 hours.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>He goes on to talk about how he is going to love and cherish Zoe ‚Äúforever‚Äù but also vows to be there for her implicitly for the next 24 hours. Confused yet? Us too! In the video description, Cody explained that it‚Äôs all for fun. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe wish this could be real, but we wanted to try it out. We're too young, and definitely need more time. Just remember, one day it'll actually happen.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who are these crazy kids in love? Get to know Cody and Zoe.</h2><p>Cody Orlove is a TikTok-turned-YouTube star, who gained fame after posting karaoke covers of popular songs on the app. He collaborates with his girlfriend and fellow Instagram and TikTok sensation Zoe LaVerne on many different videos. Although Cody <a href=#>started his TikTok career</a> alone, his popularity catapulted to a different level since teaming up with Zoe.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>cody allan orlove, i love you. i can officially say i‚Äôve been married for 24 hours ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Zoe Laverne Pemberton</a> (@zoexlaverne) on Feb 12, 2020 at 3:28pm PST</p></figure><p>The two work together on a YouTube channel where they perform trending challenges and prank each other. The couple's biggest hit is ‚Äú<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CHEATING ON MY BOYFRIEND PRANK</a>‚Äù, in which Zoe tricks Cody into thinking she was planning a date with another boy, and of course, he is heartbroken. It was viewed more than 1.5 million times in one month.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple is obviously finding new ways to garner views these days, like by faking weddings.
