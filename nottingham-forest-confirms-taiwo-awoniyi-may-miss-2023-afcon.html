And it is coming less than two days to Nottingham Forest Premier League game against Brighton at 4 p.m. on Saturday, November 25.</p><p>Before now, Taiwo Awoniyi who helped Forest to avoid relegation last season, has scored four goals in ten Premier League games so far this season.</p><p>Ahead of Forest’s league game against Brighton, Forest’s coach, Steve Cooper said: “We’ll definitely see him again this season, but it’s groin surgery so it will take a little while.”</p><p>He continued: “It’s bad news on Taiwo, he’s had to have surgery and he is going to be out for months.</p><p>“We’ll support him and try to get him back as quick and as fit as he can be, but it’s a really unfortunate situation and a blow for him.</p><p>“He’s become an important player for us with the goals he’s scored. He’s such a good guy and a good professional who is desperate to do well, so to get an injury like this is harsh on him.</p><p>“We’ve got to support him through the process of coming back stronger.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FsZqenpKm2r7PHmqRmnp%2BnsrTAjJymp56Zp7q0edOaoLCnXZbEsLrIsqBmpZGueq610qxka2hiaHqissKopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
