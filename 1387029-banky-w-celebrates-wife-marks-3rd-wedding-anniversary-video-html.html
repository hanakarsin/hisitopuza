But the only reason forever is even possible, is because we made the decision to make God our foundation. And while a foundation is the part of the house that people don't see, it's by far the most important."Because you can fix cracks in the walls, refurbish the rooms and repaint the halls, but you can't get the foundation wrong if you want any chance of the house standing at all. The structural integrity of a house requires a foundation that is built to last."I recently heard a Pastor say that love can't keep a marriage going... he said it takes God and commitment. I think maybe he had a bit of a misunderstanding of what love really means. Because... well, God IS love. And love is commitment. Without both, it certainly isn't love and it definitely won't work. People sometimes think Susu led me to God. But it's not true. God led me to Susu. And He has kept us through it all."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d5add86fc986ad5b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You left too soon!
