Unfortunately, a trigger happy policeman named TBoy who allegedly was in pursuit of Yahoo boys fired the shot that instantly killed Mrs Adebayo.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Emir Sanusi faults Buhari's economic plan</p><p class=align-left>As a result of his action, TBoy the policeman involved has robbed the Adebayo’s of their breadwinner as they lost their father a few years back. Adebayo Abayomi the deceased son spoke to<strong> Legit.ng</strong> and he disclosed how the whole situation happened and how the police are trying to bury the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt31fr80k68mog.jpeg><p class=align-left><i>“After I received the news that my mother had been gunned down by the police, we took her to the Mainland hospital in Yaba. After her body had been deposited in the morgue, we went to Olosan police station where we met the DPO who assured us that there would be justice. Surprisingly a few hours later at about 10 pm, the DPO changed his earlier statement saying that it was street touts that must have killed my mother saying the number of bullets they gave the men who were on patrol at Onipanu (where my mother was killed) are still complete in their guns and no bullets were missing. He also said that TBoy did not sign for ammunition and he was off duty and that he must have used his own personal pistol to shoot my mother. Right now, TBoy is on the run. What we just need is justice.”</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> visited Olosan police station and on getting there, we were denied access to the DPO and instead we were referred to Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer Dolapo Badmus who confirmed that the police had heard about the case.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> If you live in these states you are at the risk of meningitis (SEE FULL LIST)</p><p class=align-left><i>“What I would say is that the report got to the attention of the AIG in charge of the zone who has ordered the commissioner to investigate the case and give him feedback. This case has gotten to the highest levels of the police force and I will assure you that the AIG will not tolerate any form of injustice to any member of the public. The case will be followed to a logical solution and the police sues for peace at this point,”</i> Mrs Badmus said.</p><p class=align-left>Chidi Okereke a digital communications expert who brought the case to public knowledge shared his thoughts with <strong>Legit.ng </strong>about the case. He said <i>“Right now the government should take responsibility for this - starting with providing the family with a lawyer, ensuring autopsy is done quickly, and taking care of fees at the morgue. Just got off the phone with Abayomi, the morgue attendants have refused to treat Kudirat because they have not paid N50, 000.”</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt49vsksrus2v.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Court unfreezes Patience Jonathan's $5.9m account</p><p class=align-left>In a bid to get more clarity on Mrs Adebayo’s status, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> proceeded to the Mainland Hospital mortuary and the attendants refused to speak to us. In fact, one of the attendants threatened to burn our camera and equipment because we requested to speak to the director. The mortuary also said they could not conduct an autopsy on Mrs Adebayo anytime soon because they were severely understaffed and the only pathologist available can only come around in 3 weeks’ time. Meanwhile, the Adebayo family is being asked to pay the sum of N1, 000 for each day their mother’s body is in the morgue.</p><p class=align-left>As at the time of writing this report, the Lagos state government has not released a statement on this issue.</p><p class=align-left>We at <strong>Legit.ng</strong> sincerely hope that this case is settled as soon as possible and the police officers involved in the case brought to justice so Mrs Kudirat Adebayo can rest in peace.</p><p class=align-left>Watch <strong>Legit.ng’s</strong> exclusive report on the case below:</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ibori visits Alamieyeseigha’s grave, weeps profusely</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGFl2lwbGWgpLmqr8RmqZ6roKS7pXnRnqeoqqSoeqXB07JkqJ6WnrCmvoysn6isXaC2rbjEnWSipp6ksKa602annqykrnq1vsCdnKtmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
