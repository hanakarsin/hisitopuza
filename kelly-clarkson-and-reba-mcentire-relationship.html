This latest installment is country singer <a href=#>Blake Shelton's</a> final season as a coach, after having been with the show since its inception.</p><p><a href=#>Reba McEntire</a> also joins the cast this season as a mega mentor. She previously appeared in the competition series in 2011 as a battle advisor to Team Blake. And in a way, it‚Äôs almost like the show has come full circle with her return as Blake coaches his final group of talent.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As a mega mentor, Reba works with contestants who made it through the Battle Rounds and preps them for the Knockout rounds that begin April 17.

They both married into the same family.</h2><p>Besides being two of the most successful female country singers and collaborating multiple times on songs like Kelly's "Because of You" and Reba's "Does He Love You," the women share another tie:</p><p>Kelly is Reba's former daughter-in-law.</p><p>As a refresher, Kelly was previously married to <a href=#>Brandon Blackstock</a>. They split in June 2020 after almost seven years of marriage. They share <a href=#>two children together</a>, 8-year-old River Rose, and 6-year-old Remington Alexander. Also, Kelly is the stepmom to Brandon's two other children from a previous relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Meanwhile, Reba was married to Brandon's father, Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015. While she is not Brandon's mother (Narvel's first wife Elisa Gayle Ritter is), she was Brandon's stepmother for a large portion of his life, which overlapped with his marriage to Kelly.</p><p>So technically speaking, Reba was Kelly's <a href=#>mother-in-law</a> for only two years between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Unfortunately, Kelly's split from Brandon has been messy.</p><p>She is currently in an intense legal battle with Brandon and Narvel over unpaid commissions.
