There are already significant rumors about the actor's performance that could hint at a potential Academy Award nomination down the line, so this is one film you won't want to miss!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'The Whale' about?</h2><p>The Whale is the story of Charlie, a reclusive online English teacher who is struggling with the recent loss of his lover. As a result, Charlie resorts to compulsive eating instead. Charlie also struggles with guilt of abandoning his family for his lover, and as his health fails, Charlie reaches out to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie, in hopes of making amends. The story takes place over five days of Charlie's life in his apartment.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> about the project, playwright Samuel D. Hunter explains where he grew the concept for the play — and later, the screenplay. Samuel and his husband were both working as writing professors at Rutgers University, when he became frustrated and asked his students to write something "honest." In response, Samuel wrote a play about a teacher desperate to connect with younger people.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>He also says The Whale was inspired by other aspects of his personal life. "I arrived at it through my own personal struggles with it, as I used to be a lot bigger. This is just my story—plenty of people out there are big and happy and healthy and just fine and worthy of respect. But I was self-medicating with food, and it was hard for me to live in the world as that person. I’d never seen that story precisely told."</p><p>To accurately portray the role, Brendan Fraser utilized prosthetics, carrying an extra 50 to 300 pounds during filming. Brendan has also praised Sadie Sink's performance, saying, "I had a front-row seat to watch this kid win the game ball every single day she worked."</p><p>The Whale will be in U.S. theaters on Dec. 9, 2022. There is currently no set date when the film will be available on demand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZLCZpJi1bsDHnmSwoJGhsm6u0Z6lnZmeYrOzrdKeqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
