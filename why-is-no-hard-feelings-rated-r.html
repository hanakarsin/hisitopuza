Read for Laura's exclusive interview with Distractify!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sony Pictures</span></figure><p>Raunchy sex comedies are an American staple that had seemingly gone out of style — that was until Sony Pictures’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Hard Feelings</a> came along.</p><p>Joining the ranks of films like <a href=#>American Pie</a>, Knocked Up, and <a href=#>40-Year-Old Virgin</a> is a film starring <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> as Maddie Barker — an unlucky Uber driver who is hired to bring a well-to-do couple’s teenaged son — Percy — “out of his shell” before he leaves home and starts college.</p><p>However, it soon becomes clear that Maddie has bitten off more than she can chew.</p><p>The film is set to make its big screen debut on Friday, June 23, but theaters won’t be open to everyone. Because No Hard Feelings has an R-rating, viewers under the age of 17 have to be accompanied by an adult to gain entry. And according to actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Benanti</a>, there’s a good reason why.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sony Pictures</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘No Hard Feelings’ actress Laura Benanti said there’s a good reason why the film is rated R.</h2><p>The Motion Picture Association doesn’t play around when it comes to laying down the law. There are several reasons why a film might earn an R-rating, and No Hard Feelings certainly fits the criteria. In it, there’s some graphic nudity, sexual content, inappropriate language, and drug use, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FilmRatings.com</a>.</p><p>From skinny dipping to strip teases, there are no holds barred. Needless to say, No Hard Feelings isn’t the most child-friendly movie to drop this year, and TBH, we’re fine with that.</p><p>Actress <a href=#>Lauren Benanti</a> plays Allison, Percy’s mom, alongside her onscreen husband, <a href=#>Matthew Broderick</a>, in No Hard Feelings. In an exclusive interview with Distractify, she hinted at some of the debauchery that takes place in the film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sony Pictures</span></figure><p>When we asked how the June 2023 movie measures up to the iconic American sex comedies that came before it, Laura said No Hard Feelings takes the art of indecency “a step further” than what we’re used to.</p><p>“I think there's one scene in particular that is really pushing the boundary of it, you know? I really, I think it stays true to its R rating,” Laura told us. “So it's not for kids.”</p><p>Laura, who has two children of her own IRL, said that although she isn’t one to mom-shame, parents might want to find a babysitter when and if they step out to see this feature film, as it’s definitely not safe for family night.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sony Pictures</span></figure><p>“I'm a mom,” the actress added. “So, I don't want to tell anybody else how to raise their children. I don't think it's for children. I think you should be at least 16 to see this movie."</p><p>You heard it from the horse’s mouth, folks! Keep the kiddies at home unless you’re ready to answer some pretty awkward questions!</p><p>Reporting by Bianca Piazza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKenXZ2us7CMn5yepJmjtLR50Zqrnpxdpw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
