Of course, markets need to be regulated and have boundaries, but I think that it is too easy to blame markets when sometimes the problem might be from within.</p><p>“I think there is nobody who is knowledgeable that does not know that for a number of years, policymakers were the biggest problem with the forex market.</p><p>“Let us not deceive ourselves, the current order has ruined the forex market, so for those who made such decisions to now complain, I think it is uncharitable.
