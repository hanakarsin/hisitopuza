(They said we are all at fault. We don’t have the sympathy of anyone. We are on our own).”</p><p>He warned that his administration would no longer&nbsp;allow violent demonstrations in Nigeria, adding: “democracy does not mean confusion or lack of accountability.”</p><p>“We do not stop anyone from demonstrating, but you don’t set up roadblocks and smash windscreens. Which government will allow that?’’</p><p>Recall that protesting youths in Nigeria agitating for the end to police brutalization and extrajudicial killings of Nigerians had stormed the streets, protesting the brutalities, humiliation, and extortion of Nigerians, especially the youths.</p><p>On Sunday, October 11, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), <strong>Mohammed Adamu</strong>, disbanded SARS following widespread protest from Nigerians worldwide. However, the announcement that SARS has been scrapped did not take protesters from the streets which resulted in the declaration of a curfew by the Lagos government.</p><p>Following the curfew, soldiers of the Nigerian Army invaded a peaceful protest at Lekki toll gate on Tuesday evening, October 20, shooting at #EndSARS protesters in the process.</p><p>But the army who initially denied involvement in the Lekki shootings, later disclosed that its officers were invited by the Lagos State Governor, <strong>Babajide Sanwo-Olu</strong>, to enforce a curfew imposed on the state last Tuesday.</p><p>The Nigerian Army also denied allegations that it shot at peaceful protesters, saying it merely fired blanks into the air to disperse stone-throwers.</p><p>But a special report by the CNN revealed that&nbsp;soldiers shot at protesters, killing many. The investigation uncovered the bullets used as a 2015 brand from Serbia. This refuted the claims from the army denying the use of live ammunition.</p><p>But Nigeria’s Minister for Information,&nbsp;<strong>Lai Mohammed</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>denied the report of the US based cable television</strong></a>.</p><p>Speaking during a televised press conference, Mohammed called for a sanction on CNN over the report, adding that the report&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lekki tollgate incident as highly irresponsible</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49yZputmJa%2FqnnRqJisrKNisK%2B6jJuZnGWUnsCowdKtoKefXZq7pb%2FAq6pmqKKkwaa%2F02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
