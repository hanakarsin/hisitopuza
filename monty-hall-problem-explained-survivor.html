We first saw contestants face the prisoner’s dilemma in a fun post-challenge twist. Now, with only seven players left in the game, host and producer Jeff Probst introduced a <a href=#>new twist, called “Do or Die."</a></p><p>As <a href=#>Deshawn Radden</a> is forced to play his chance in the game, <a href=#>Xander</a> remarks that it’s the Monty Hall problem. But what exactly is the Monty Hall problem and what does that mean in Survivor?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>In this twist, the contestant will have to make a choice that will affect their position in the game. If they choose wrong, they go home, and if they choose correctly, they’ll be safe and hence secure a position in the final six. <a href=#>Liana and Heather</a> choose not to participate in the challenge, and Deshawn ultimately drops first.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Deshawn is faced with a Monty Hall–style problem in ‘Survivor 41.’</h2><p>In Episode 11 of Survivor, Jeff explains that by participating in the immunity challenge, players are doubly risking their chance at survival in the game. Of course, there’s always a risk in an immunity challenge, but typically, losing comes at no cost.</p><p>However, in this case, even playing is a risk. Jeff reveals that whoever is out of the immunity challenge first will be forced to participate in a twist called “Do or Die.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>In some ways, this is a blessing for Deshawn. He had a major target on his back and everyone wanted him out, so if he chooses correctly in the “Do or Die” twist, he could save himself.</p><p>On the other hand, he might have very slim odds when it comes to securing his position. At the highly anticipated tribal council, in which contestants aren’t even sure if they’ll be voting, Deshawn is faced with choosing one box out of three.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Monty Hall problem deals with giving yourself the highest odds when picking one of three options.</h2><p>The problem is actually named after the host of <a href=#>Let’s Make a Deal</a>, Monty Hall. In the show, contestants are faced with picking one option out of three.</p><p>If they choose wrong, they lose, but if they choose correctly, they win a prize. In Survivor, Jeff presents Deshawn with three boxes. Two have pictures of skulls inside, whereas one has a picture of a flame. If he picks the flame, he stays in the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>He picks the first box. However, Jeff reveals the contents of the third box, and then gives Deshawn the option to switch his choice. According to writer Marilyn vos Savant, the correct choice would have been to switch. This is because after picking the first box, the other two have a ⅔ likelihood of being correct. When one of those is eliminated, the other box takes on that ⅔ likelihood.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tonight we saw one of the highest stakes games of the Monty Hall problem in human history on <a href=#>@survivorcbs</a>.</p><p>You can prove to yourself you are statistically TWICE as likely to win if you *SWITCH* boxes by playing over and over again here:<a href=#>https://t.co/7m41pjYJZP</a><a href=#>#Survivor</a> <a href=#>#Math</a></p>— Christian Hubicki (@chubicki) <a href=#>December 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Survivor is all about vibes, though, so Deshawn sticks with his initial gut feeling and his initial box. It pays dividends when that box turns out to be the fire, but according to theorists and to practice, he should have switched. Regardless, it just goes to show that ⅔ odds still isn’t 100 percent, and sometimes following your gut is the best way to go.</p><p>New episodes of Survivor air every Wednesday at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyvwNhmn5qknGK9s7vBpZymZZWtva2tyKecnWWjqr%2B3tdWoqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
