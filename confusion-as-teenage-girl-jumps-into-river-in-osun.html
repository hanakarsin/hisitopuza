Before anybody could do anything, she was already in the river and we did not see any trace of her again,” Daily Post quoted Olaleye as saying.</p><p>According to her, she and other passersby immediately raised an alarm and contacted the Federal Fire Service who also arrived at the scene within minutes.</p><p>Unfortunately according to her, there was little they could do as several minutes of rescue efforts proved abortive.</p><p>“After several minutes of fruitless search, the firefighters left the scene without recording any success. The water level has increased because of the rain and that also made it more difficult for her to be found. No one could enter the river because of its intensity,” Olaleye added.</p><p>No details have emerged yet on why the young lady committed <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>suicide</strong></a> and who she was talking with on the phone before the incident.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that as of reporting time, no official statement has been issued yet by the Federal Fire Service office in Osogbo to this effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FqZpynnpvCtLXOp2Saq12psqa6wKCcZp%2BZp7luttSmp6xlmaPBsHnRoq2eql2eu2670q6laA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
