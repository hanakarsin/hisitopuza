"Ruthie on <a href=#>Shrill</a> is the only thing I care about in this whole entire galaxy," writes one viewer on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.</p><p>Her hilarious one-liners, the fact that she is "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1000% wildin'</a> with no repercussions" and the caricature she portrays of a wealthy Southern California white woman have Shrill fans absolutely obsessed.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, many viewers who are calling the second season of the Hulu series "disappointing" and "problematic" can still take solace is the hilarity Ruthie's character provides.</p><p>But who is the actress behind Ruthie? Keep reading for what you need to know about <a href=#>Shrill's trans comedian Patti Harrison</a>, and how to follow the rising star on social media.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hulu</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ruthie's character was written with Patti Harrison in mind.</h2><p>Ruthie plays Gabe's malevolent office assistant who was introduced in Season 1 of the show and really comes to life in the second season.</p><p>"I think she's got the brain of a wasp," is how Patti Harrison irreverently described her character on the show in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>. "Not like, white Anglo-Saxon. I'm talking about an actual insect, a wasp. I don't think she thinks too far ahead."</p><p>In Season 2, Ruthie formally decides to come out to her co-workers, and Patti, who is also trans, revealed that she had a lot of input in writing Ruthie's arc on the show and in making sure she didn't fall into any clich√©s of "trauma porn."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hulu</span></figure><p>Patti explained to Vanity Fair why her character gets so incensed when her coworker Amadi correlates the fact that she's trans with an assumption that she must have had a traumatic childhood and family life.</p><p>"There's just so much representation of trans women specifically ... [and] so much of it is, like, in order to try and get people to have empathy for a person, they have to show the most traumatic violence, sexual violence," she said to the outlet in an uncharacteristically introspective and serious tone.</p><p>"There is truth to that for sure, and it's authentic in a lot of ways," she continued. "But as a trans person who's a viewer, seeing that stuff all the time is really unhealthy. It really informs a cultural perception of your story, which is why I think representation and telling people's stories authentically is important."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>2 THINGS: 1Ô∏è‚É£In honor of SHRILL SEASON 2 dropping on Jan 24th, here are some BTS photos of some of my fav whore & hole looks & some SERIOUS S2 SPOILERS: My character becomes slutty OC Realtor & I have unsimulated sex w The ATL Twins & you know what?
