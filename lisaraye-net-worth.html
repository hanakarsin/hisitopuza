If that’s their way of collecting a check and they want to be bothered with something that they didn’t want to be bothered with in the beginning — for 18 years or the rest of their life — then have at it, 'cause that’s exactly what they’re doing,” LisaRaye said (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a>).

"I don’t even keep up because … seriously, I want to speak and be around folks that’s doing something and not just collecting a bag because ‘it’s about the money.’ Because all money ain’t good money and we heard that before. You need to make the money, don’t let the money make you.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This comes after LisaRaye made some comments about Ari on a Jan. 20, 2022, episode of Queens with Cocktails.

There’s a difference …Respectable people, respect you."</p><p>LisaRaye continued: "She was out of line, out of place. She was immature. For the women that look up to her, I hope that they hold her accountable for what she says. I hope that she is learning a lesson to at least come back and say, ‘you know what, I apologize.’ But she needs to give us some type of apology or narrative…”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>LisaRaye didn’t say anything wrong, nor did she personally mention Ari’s name.
