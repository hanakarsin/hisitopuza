His two songs, <i>La Bamba</i> and <i>Donna</i>, dominated the charts in the late 1950s. He was so good at writing songs that the future was all in his hands.

His parents were José Esteban Valenzuela (father) and Concepción 'Concha' Reyes (mother). Valens' father died in 1952 when the singer was 11 years old, while his mother died in 1987.</p><p class=align-left>Ritchie Valens' parents came from Mexico and shared an Indian extraction. Steven was the second born in a <a href=#>family</a> of five children. The names of Ritchie Valens' siblings are Connie, Irma, Robert Morales, and Mario Ramirez.</p><p class=align-left>Ritchie Valens' brother, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bob Morales</a>, the eldest of the siblings, died in 2018 at 81 years. While growing up, Steven attended Pacoima Junior High School, now Pacoima Middle School. He also studied at San Fernando High School.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/776325bd11499f5c.jpg><p class=align-left>Valens' love for music began when he was five years old. He started playing the guitar and trumpet and later taught himself the drums. The singer would even take his guitar to school and sing and play <a href=#>songs </a>to his colleagues.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/71763a77e2fb6a3f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vin Diesel's sexuality, current partner, and dating history</span></p></a><h2>Family, wife, children</h2><p class=align-left>Ritchie Steven was only <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">17 years old </a>when he died. He dated a girl from a wealthy family called Donna Ludwig. She was 15 years old. Donna inspired Valens to release the song <i>Donna </i>in 1959. A year before its release, Valens had sung the song to her over the telephone.</p><p class=align-left>Steven began singing for Donna another hit song called <i>We Belong Together</i>. Although the song became famous even after Valens' death, it was the couple's song. The love shared between the two was so immense, despite being teenagers. Donna had a scrapbook with pictures of Valens and herself when they were together.</p><p class=align-left>Donna dated Valens against her father's wishes. Steven came from a low-income family and lived in a shack on the other side of town. Donna's father managed a Packard automobile dealership in Beverly Hills. As a result, she sometimes sneaked out of her bedroom window to meet Valens in San Fernando.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22f9df287e870eb9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quando Rondo bio: hood, net worth, siblings, death rumours</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Had it not been for his untimely death, Donna would probably have been Ritchie Valens' wife. But Steven might have dated another woman too before his death. The woman was from New York named Diane Olson. She showed up at Ritchie Valens' funeral and told the Valenzuela family she was engaged to their late son. However, nobody knew about Diane Olson, including Valens' friends, family members, and his agent.</p><h2>Professional career</h2><p class=align-left>Ritchie Steven started singing around 15 years old. He joined a band called The Silhouettes and played gigs at local establishments. After that, people began noticing his talents, including Bob Keane, the head of the record label Del-Fi Records.</p><p class=align-left>Steven released his first song through Del-Fi records in 1958 titled<i> Come On, Let's Go</i>. The song became a minor hit since it was new to people. At this time, Keane advised the singer to shorten his name to Valens to make it easier for people to remember.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c71db2378250057.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Hurst: height, wife, family, net worth, religion, characters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1958, Steven released two singles,<i> La Bamba </i>and <i>Donna</i>. Donna became the most popular ballad in the USA, reaching number two on the charts. But a unique thing with <i>La Bamba</i> is that although it was a top 40 hit in the US charts, it also became a revolutionary song. People liked <i>La Bamba </i>because it fused two elements, rock and roll and Mexican folk tune.</p><p class=align-left>The double-A side record of La Bamba and Donna were the final songs released by Valens. It sold over one million records, gaining a gold disc from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Steven did not live to see the fruits of his labour as he died on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">3 February 1959</a> in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, United States. The events of the day later became known as The Day the Music Died.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8ca37499d92811c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wolfgang Van Halen: net worth, parents, wife, career, weight loss</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ad30a53555c81273.png><h2>Ritchie Valens' net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Ritchie Steven was only active for two years in the music industry before his untimely death.
