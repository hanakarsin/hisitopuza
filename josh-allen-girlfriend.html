His great-grandfather immigrated from Sweden in 1907 and put down roots in Firebaugh during the Great Depression, and Josh’s grandfather established the family farm there in 1975, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a 2017</u> <u>ESPN</u> <u>profile</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>“It’s a small town, everybody knows everybody and news travels fast,” Josh said at the time. “It was an experience I wouldn’t trade for anything because it kind of shaped who I am today.”</p><p>Josh graduated from Firebaugh High School, where the gymnasium is named after his grandfather. As of the 2017 ESPN profile, Josh’s father and uncle were still running the farm, growing about 3,000 acres of Pima cotton, cantaloupes, and wheat.</p><p>Josh said at the time that growing up on the family farm inspired his work ethic.</p><p>“Seeing my dad wake up super early when the sun wasn’t even out and then coming home when the sun was set, he worked his tail off to provide for our family and did a great job," he said. "He’s the most selfless man I know, and I think if I’m half the man he is, I’ll be all right in this world.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did Josh Allen go to college?</h2><p>Josh initially attended Reedley College, a junior college in Reedley, Calif. During his first year there, he sent more than 1,000 emails to college football programs, asking them to give him a chance as quarterback. As ESPN reported, only two colleges offered him a scholarship: Eastern Michigan University and the University of Wyoming.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Josh Allen (@joshallenqb)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“Yeah, I was disappointed,” Josh said. “I couldn’t believe it. I truly felt like I was a Division I quarterback, and I’d felt that way for a long time. I just wanted other people to see it.”</p><p>Other people did see it, finally, after Josh joined Wyoming’s football program and threw more than 3,000 yards and 28 touchdowns in a single season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Josh Allen’s girlfriend?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Page Six</u></a>, Josh’s girlfriend is Pilates instructor Brittany Williams.
