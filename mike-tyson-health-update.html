"Maybe he just wanted a ride? I hope so," wrote one fan on Twitter in response to the photos. Another chirped: "What happened?! He seemed just fine this past year!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mike Tyson spotted in wheelchair at Miami airport <a href=#>https://t.co/9trvhXqEhN</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bpUZx5uLoi</a></p>— New York Post (@nypost) <a href=#>August 16, 2022</a></figure><p>A few weeks before the airport photos circulated, Mike was seen in New York City using a walking stick as a cane, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. At the time, sources close to Mike explained the situation. "He’s dealing with a sciatica flare-up," they told the outlet. "Nothing serious. Just an occupational hazard for an athlete like Mike."</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MedicineNet</a>, a sciatica flare-up, known as spatica, is "a medical condition where an individual feels pain radiating from the sciatic nerve." The sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down to the legs, is the largest nerve in the body and is responsible for motor function in the lower body.</p><p>But while a sciatica flare-up is unfortunate, it can be easily treated. That said, Mike hinted that he may be dealing with another medical issue on a July episode of his podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson</a>.</p><p>On the episode, Mike spoke with therapist Sean McFarland, who specializes in trauma and addiction. In their discussion, Mike gave a pretty jarring statement about his death. “We’re all gonna die one day, of course,” he said to Sean, adding, “Then, when I look in the mirror, I see those little spots on my face, I say, ‘Wow. That means my expiration date is coming close, really soon.'”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p style=text-align:start>Mike also spoke on how having money doesn't equate to happiness and that it provides "a false sense of security."</p><p style=text-align:start>However, it was Mike's comment regarding his "expiration date" that seemed to stick with fans. The ex-pro boxer has yet to explain exactly what he meant by that statement, but we're all hoping that his health improves soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforassYytsKynnmK1pq3LrZ9mraCZrrWx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
