"It's almost like a physical death and the death of the soul when it comes to betrayal."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alina reveals the season finale is a “case of closure” for the Armitage family.</h2><p>Although Alina can't turn back time to fix the procedural errors of Richard's case, she disclosed to Distractify that this episode could serve "as a warning" to others going through something similar. Additionally, the CSI veteran revealed that this was for sure a "case of closure" for the Armitage family.</p><p>"I think being able to talk about this did bring some closure in this case and kind of allowed them to talk about what a great man Richard was," Alina told Distractify. She noted that since the general public only knew of Richard because of this tragedy, the episode allowed his family to discuss their loved one in a way that wasn't overshadowed by his violent death.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Investigation Discovery</span></figure><p>"You know, you might have a picture of him in his head is this hardworking attorney that's never there, [but] the picture that I have of him in my head now is his daughter playing softball and looking to the stands and seeing him there cheering for her."</p><p>Alina continued, "Nobody gets to know, you know, who he was raising his children, and that he attended all of his children's sporting events even though he was a busy, accomplished attorney."</p><p>Crime Scene Confidential — "Doing Right By Richard" — airs Tuesday, April 19 at 9 p.m. EST on ID and is available to stream the same day on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2BqucRmqpydnpp6pLvNn6CdnZ6ptqK4jJ%2Bgp5mcmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
