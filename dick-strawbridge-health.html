There’s a real sense of history to it,” Dick said. “I was in the Army for 20 years and moved a lot. I keep my medals in there, plus the first teeth and locks of hair of my older children James and Charlotte, and my son Arthur, 7, and daughter Dorothy, 6.”</p><p>(According to House Beautiful, Dick welcomed James and Charlotte with his first wife, Brigit A.
