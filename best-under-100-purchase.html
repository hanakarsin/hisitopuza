My boyfriend makes sweet comments about how much he loves my perfumes and that he wants to get some nice cologne, but he didn't want to spend that much money on one. So, the other day he came with me to Sephora, and I was smelling and testing perfumes. He tested out a Dior cologne, really enjoyed it, but then realized the price. I could tell he really fancied that cologne, so I bought it right then and there for him.He tells me every day how much he loves it and all the compliments he gets. It may not be as cool or interesting as other things, but my boyfriend's joy was enough to make my heart happy.Edit: The cologne was Dior Sauvage.<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eclantantfille</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Multiples of Cheap Items/Goods.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: amazon</a></figure>A sh--load of dish towels.I decided a couple of years ago that I was going to make a conscious effort to deal with all the minor irritations in my life. First on the list was the fact that I never had a dish towel clean and on-hand when I needed one. Boom! Problem solved. That tiny little frustration that I experienced multiple times a day — wiping up spills, getting something out of the oven, putting a hot tray down on a work surface — was gone immediately.So I started branching out to other things. Ever spent more than two minutes looking for a pair of tweezers? Or a corkscrew? Well, they're cheap. Buy multiples! Have them on hand! Get that minor annoyance out of your life!(Here's where someone invariably points out that I could just always make sure that I put them in the same place and solve the problem that way, but let's be real: Have you never accidentally knocked something small down the side of the couch? Or lent it to someone and had them not return it for ages? Or even just moved on to something more important, like when you're using tweezers to pull something gross like a shard of glass out of your foot? Having multiples means that you've got a nice little buffer in case your perfect plan goes astray.)<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Portarossa</u></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Car Phone Holder.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure>That thing you clip into your car's A/C vent to hold up your phone.<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">yeah_icalleduabetch</a></p><p>Nothing better than not getting into an accident while following your navigation.</p><p>What are some of your favorite purchases that didn't break the bank?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ6pnnxzfJBxZmlwX2aAcKaRnn%2BrqZVkr6a%2F02asp5yVp3pyfI9mp66qk52utLE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
