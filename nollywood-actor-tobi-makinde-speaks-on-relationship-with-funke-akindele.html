It has been a learning curve for me. I have seen growth, and I have learned a lot from her. She is quite a professional and a disciplinarian. She knows her onions, and I am following that path because the success she has made today is outstanding. This is what I have always wanted since my path is filmmaking, just like hers. I also want to be like her. I want to be celebrated as she is being celebrated today.”</p><p>Tobi Makinde noted that he expected the movie ‘A Tribe Called Judah’ to make a mark, but he did not know it would be very outstanding.</p><p>He said, “I am excited and overwhelmed by the reception that the movie has gotten. Was it expected? Yes, it was. I wouldn’t lie. From reading the script, it was a good story. It was something that was relatable and people can resonate with. As much as I expected it this way, I did not expect it to be this huge. This is a big win for Nollywood for the fact that it is breaking a very big record. It has grossed over a billion naira. That is a big win for the executive producer Funke Akindele, the actors, crew members, and the industry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FuZqennKHGuLvOnWSam6Skv27AzpugZqWRoLavsMRmqqmdkaDAbrvNZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWnnsGpecWupaSdXZa4qrrDnqOeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
