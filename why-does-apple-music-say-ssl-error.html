Whether it's a hiccup that affects multiple users at once or our devices simply choose to be uncooperative at key moments, it's not uncommon for an app to display some sort of error or simply not work properly. For the most part, it's on the technical side of things to address an issue. It can usually be chalked up to a new update not working properly or servers just being temperamental from time to time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But that's a pretty vague answer that doesn't necessarily satisfy anyone who may be experiencing an issue. You would hope that someone would be able to provide an explanation for your app-related woes.</p><p>Take <a href=#>Apple Music</a>, for example. The popular music, audio, and video streaming service from Apple is prone to error messages like any other service. One that gives people particular frustration is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SSL Error</a>. Why does Apple Music display that message sometimes?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Apple Music say "SSL Error" sometimes? Here's what you should know.</h2><p>An SSL Error message can be a bit of a weird one for Apple Music users. Chances are that if you've tried to open the app at one point, you've run into a notification that reads "An SSL Error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made," or something along those lines. No, this isn't necessarily one of those purposeful design flaws that Apple products have to incentivize you into purchasing more stuff. It's a legitimate error but a casual headache.</p><p>"SSL" actually stands for "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Sockets Layer</a>". This function typically safeguards your internet connection whenever your device is sending or receiving information from another. It's meant to prevent anyone from seeing or even modifying the data being sent. With that in mind, an SSL error means that a secure connection between your device and an app (ie., Apple Music) could not be established right away.</p><p>Unlike most errors that tend to be all but inexplicable, this is a pretty clear-cut issue.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you're looking to fix the problem, however, you may be looking at some rather familiar solutions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here are some ways on how to fix an SSL Error in Apple Music.</h2><p>There are all sorts of things to try in order to resolve an SSL Error. There's the usual method of checking your internet connection to see if your wi-fi is stable. You can also check if there's an update available for your app or even clear the app cache. You may even want to try restarting your device.</p><p>Of course, there are other more specific solutions. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EDMSauce</a> recommends checking the date and time in the app to see if they're correct, as Apple Music's encryption may be affected by inaccurate timestamps.</p><p>Another person on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> recommended this unique solution:</p><ul><li>Go to Settings and scroll down to Music</li><li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and make sure that "Home Sharing" is enabled</li></ul><p>Hopefully, one of these methods will help solve the SSL Error on your Apple Music app.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlkaW9rbGMpqysoZNiwKLFjKyqpWWVp7%2Bwvg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
