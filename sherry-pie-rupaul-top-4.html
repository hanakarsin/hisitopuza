The series is a beloved piece of representation for the LGBTQ community, but it has recently been hit with a nasty controversy, hurting the experience of the show for some in the community.</p><p>Joey Gugliemelli, who performs under the stage name <a href=#>Sherry Pie, has already been disqualified</a> before the season is even halfway over — even though she might be a <a href=#>top 4 contestant</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sherry Pie was possibly in the top 4 of 'RuPaul' Season 12 before being accused of sexual misconduct.</h2><p>In a public Facebook post by Ben Shimkus, who claims to have known Sherry while she was in college, he accuses Sherry of sexual misconduct, catfishing him to received sexually suggestive videos.</p><p>Ben claims that while he was a student at the State University of New York at Cortland, he and Sherry were good friends — she even introduced him to RuPaul's Drag Race while it was still in some of its early seasons.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"Sherry and I also have an extensive history beyond our time at Cortland. In the summers, we worked together at a summer stock theatre in a small town in western Michigan," he shared. "In all, we performed in more than 15 shows together. I even performed as a dancer in two of her drag performances when she was still in central New York."</p><p>After Sherry left the university, she gave a mutual friend of Ben's the contact information for a woman named "Allison Mossey," claiming she wanted to scout him for a huge role with Playwrights Horizons in New York City.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>I have a weird story to tell about Sherry Pie RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 12 started last week. It is an exciting time in...</p>Posted by <a href=#>Ben Shimkus</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Wednesday, March 4, 2020</a><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>"Allison and I went through an email thread that lasted over 150 emails in about three weeks," Ben said. "We covered topics of pay, living situations in the city, when I would have to leave school for rehearsals, and conversations about acting choices for the character. I had to film scenes that felt particularly sexual and awkward, but the opportunity seemed too good to let the overt sexual nature or my inhibitions get in the way... I wanted the professional experience and the bright and shiny object on my resume."</p><p>But after months of endless back and forth, Ben eventually decided to contact Playwrights Horizons about Allison — only to find out no one of that name was employed there.</p><p>"I reached out to the friend who originally got this email contact. He too was in a callback for a different show with the same woman. I told him not to contact her again. I also asked where he had gotten the contact from. It was from Sherry Pie, who was adamant about her friendship with Allison," he wrote. "Since being open about my experience, six people have corroborated stories with me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"I hope that Sherry has learned that Allison is not a persona that she can hide behind if she wants to objectify other gay men," he said, concluding that he would not be able to watch this season of RuPaul's Drag Race because of the situation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sherry did not deny the allegations in a Facebook post of her own.</h2><p>Once Ben's story came to light, Joe quickly took to the Sherry Pie social media pages to address the rumors — and didn't really deny anything.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is Joey, I want to start by saying how sorry I am that I caused such trauma and pain and how horribly embarrassed and disgusted I am with myself," he wrote. "I know that the pain and hurt that I have caused will never go away and I know that what I did was wrong and truly cruel."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>LETS LAUGH !!!

"Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned.&nbsp;Sherry will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring.”</p><p>This statement also appeared at the beginning of the first episode to air after the allegations came to light. While Sherry received little screen time, she still managed to win that round of the competition, leading some to believe that she may have made it to the top 4 contestants.</p><p>"This episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race was filmed in 2019,” a statement read at the end of the episode.“In light of recent developments, VH1 and World of Wonder have donated $5,000 to The Trevor Project.”</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>RAINN.org</strong></u></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWmvtGyZKmhlWK%2FtrzArqNmrJ%2BlenU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
