But there are a number of tracks that have gone viral as a result of various challenges and popular viral trends, and Halsey is saying that their record label is essentially forcing them to create a "fake" viral video on TikTok before they release any of their new music.</p><p>Halsey spilled the beans about this practice to her fans ... in a TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @halsey</span></figure><p>In a recent video, Halsey can be seen looking into the camera and bopping their head around as the following text comes up as an overlay on the screen: "Basically I have a song that I love that I wanna release ASAP. But my record label won't let me. I've been in this industry for eight years and I've sold over 165 million records and my record company is saying that I can't release it unless they can fake a viral moment on TikTok."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@halsey href=#>@halsey</a><p>I‚Äôm tired</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Halsey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Halsey</a></figure><p>She continued, "Everything is marketing. And they are doing this to basically every artist these days. I just wanna release music, man. And I deserve better tbh. I'm tired."</p><p>Halsey went on to respond to a commenter's claims that their TikTok was the viral video the label asked for, to which Halsey replied, "Bruh I wish it was haha. They just said I have to post TikToks they didn‚Äôt specifically say ‚Äòabout what‚Äô so here I am."</p><p>The singer added that the label had requested no fewer than six "viral" TikTok videos in order to help promote the song. Halsey has been signed to Astralwerks, a division of Capitol Records, since 2014.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@halsey href=#>@halsey</a> <a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Halsey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Halsey</a></figure><p>Twitter user @alluregaga2 has posted screenshots from other musicians who are alleging they are experiencing the same pressure from their own management teams.</p><p>The tweet features TikTok screen captures from FKA Twigs, Charli XCX, and Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>what tiktok has done to the music industry is upsetting like‚Ä¶ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bSJ0EIVfv1</a></p>‚Äî allure (@alluregaga2) <a href=#>May 22, 2022</a></figure><p>Adele, who broke records after the release of her album "30," once said in an interview that she had to flat out tell her label that there wasn't any way she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">going to design songs made for TikTok</a>.</p><p>Halsey's TikTok went viral, something that seemingly delighted their label.
