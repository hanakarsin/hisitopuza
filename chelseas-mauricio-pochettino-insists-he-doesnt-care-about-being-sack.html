Yet, they are one of the most unstable elite clubs in Europe.</p><p>Pochettino has not been able to make any tangible difference at the club so far as they have been struggling especially in the Premier League.</p><p>So far this season, the Argentine tactician has led Chelsea to 10 wins, four draws, and 10 defeats. This abysmal run has left them in the 10th spot in the league table with 34 points in 24 games.</p><p>Due to this negative form, there has been a series of speculations that Chelsea are planning to sack coach Pochettino.</p><p>But ahead of Chelsea’s league game against Manchester City at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, February 17, coach Pochettino who could get around £10 million if he is sacked this season, said, “I don’t care about the rumours.”</p><p>He continued, “I don’t care about the tension. I don’t care about the pressure. I don’t care about the stress.</p><p>“We know really well which is our reality and we are going to keep working.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BuZpyglaHApq3SZqSaraKesKq7jKmmnKCVqcGqus5moKermajBtHnHnmSdp5Wou7V5wpqpnmWRl7y2wIybnKKml2LAoq%2FKaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
