presidential ambitions.</h2><p>Although the ministers have the right to occupy the highest office in the country, they have to resign from their positions thirty days before the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primaries.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that three Ministers have formally joined the presidential race and two others have declared their governorship aspirations.</p><p>While few others rumoured to be nursing similar ambitions are consulting stakeholders in the ruling party before formally declaring their aspirations.</p><p>In this article, we would be looking at the ministers seeking elective positions and their manifestos.</p><h3>Presidential hopefuls</h3><p><strong>Rotimi Amaechi</strong></p><p>Former Governor of Rivers State and Minister of Transportation, <a href=#><strong>Rotimi Amaechi</strong></a>, became the first minister appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari <strong><a href=#>to declare his presidential ambition</a></strong>.</p><p>The minister had <a href=#><strong>released</strong> <strong>an 86-page brochure</strong></a> titled, “Qualified to Serve” to market his 2023 presidential aspiration.</p><p>On April 9, 2022, Amaechi formally announced his presidential bid at a Thanksgiving ceremony organised by the Rivers APC at the Port Harcourt Stadium, Port Harcourt.</p><p>The minister stated that he declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election to make a positive impact on the lives of Nigerians.</p><p>Amaechi pointed out that he is well equiped for the most important office in the country and has compassion for the country.</p><p>He added that he has the required experience needed for the presidency having occupied several political positions in the past both in the executive and legislative arms of government.</p><p>Amaechi, however, used the opportunity to show his fitness for the task ahead by jogging around the stadium to the admiration of his supporters and associates.</p><p>Those present at Amaechi’s declaration include Governor&nbsp;<strong>Simon Lalong</strong>&nbsp;of Plateau State; former APC National Chairman, Comrade&nbsp;<strong>Adams Oshiomole</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>Senator Ali Ndume</strong>; Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives&nbsp;<strong>Ahmed Idris Wase</strong>; Minister of State for Transportation,&nbsp;<strong>Gbemisola Saraki</strong>; former Jigawa State Governor,&nbsp;<strong>Jibrilla Bindow</strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris Ngige</strong></p><p>On April 19, former Governor of Anambra State and Minister of Labour and Employment, <a href=#><strong>Chris Ngige</strong></a>, formally made public his <strong><a href=#>intention to contest the 2023 presidency</a></strong>.</p><p>Ngige declared his presidential ambition before a mammoth crowd at St. Mary’s Catholic Church Alor, Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State.</p><p>The minister described himself as an aspirant well equipped with years of administrative experience due to his 40 years of experience in the public service.</p><p>He said he has a huge wealth of experience, capacity and energy as well as a large heart to accommodate the differences among Nigerians.</p><p>The former Anambra governor stated that he consulted with stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress and the opposition parties before announcing his presidential bid.</p><p><strong>Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba</strong></p><p>On April 27, the Minister of State for Education, <a href=#><strong>Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba</strong></a>, formally, made known his <strong><a href=#>intention to contest the 2023 presidential election</a></strong>.</p><p>Nwajiuba obtained his Nomination and Expression of Interest forms valued at N100m at the International Conference Center (ICC) in Abuja.</p><p>Speaking with reporters, the minister said, a support group, known as Project Nigeria, reportedly sourced the funds for him to purchase the forms.</p><p>Nwajiuba stated that President Buhari has achieved a lot in the aspect of infrastructure in the last seven years, stressing that more achievements would be recorded before the expiration of the president’s tenure.</p><p>Reacting to calls for the resignation of political appointees of President Buhari seeking elective positions, Nwajiuba said he will not be resigning from his position as directed by the APC.</p><p>The minister stressed that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) permitted aspirants to resign 30 days before the election and no other law has been formulated regarding the issue.</p><p>Nwajiuba asserted that he will be adhering to the constitution and not resign from his position ahead of the APC presidential primaries billed for May 30 to June 1, 2022.</p><h3><strong>Governorship hopefuls</strong></h3><p><strong>Uche Ogah</strong></p><p>The Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, <a href=#><strong>Uche Sampson Ogah</strong></a>, was the first minister to formally declare <strong><a href=#>his intention to run for governorship</a></strong> in 2023.</p><p>On April 13, the minister declared his intention to run for the Abia governorship race in 2023 at his country home in Onuaku Uturu in Isiukwato Local Government Area of the state.</p><p>Ogah stated that his decision to join the governorship race was a result of the call by his kinsmen to contribute his quota to the development of the South Eastern state.</p><p><strong>Abubakar Malami</strong></p><p>On Thursday, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), <a href=#><strong>Abubakar Malami</strong></a>, joined the race for the Kebbi State governorship seat in 2023.</p><p>He <strong><a href=#>declared his intention to run for the presidency</a></strong> at the presidential hall in Birnin-Kebbi during an interactive session with APC stakeholders in the state, putting an end to months of speculation.</p><p>The minister had earlier in the month denied&nbsp;media reports that had quoted him declaring to become the next governor of the North East state.</p><p>Malami claimed that the video quoted by various news outlets which showed him declaring his governorship ambition was translated with fabricated insertions.</p><p>However, during his governorship declaration, Malami said joined the race in response to calls from his people to serve the state as their governor.</p><p>Malami said he has contributed a lot to the country and also to the state in areas of employment generation, fight against poverty, agricultural revolution and women empowerment.</p><p><strong>Others</strong></p><p>Some ministers are also rumoured to be nursing presidential and governorship ambitions and are currently consulting with stakeholders in the ruling party.</p><p>Among those reportedly seeking elective positions are the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, <a href=#><strong>Isa Pantami</strong></a>, who is rumoured to be interested in running for governor of Gombe State.</p><p>Also, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, <a href=#><strong>Sunday Dare</strong></a>, is rumoured to be seeking to contest the Oyo State governorship seat.</p><p>Editor’s note: This list will be updated as more ministers declare their political ambitions and their plans for Nigerians ahead of the 2023 elections.</p><p class=postsid
