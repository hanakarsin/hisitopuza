But why is Joy Duggar not on 'Counting On'?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar (along with their brood of 19 children) have starred in various TLC reality shows for more than a decade now. From 17 Kids & Counting to <a href=#>Counting On</a>, viewers keep coming back for more ‚Äî not only to gain insight into how a family that massive works, logistically, but also because of the highly religious/conservative way they raise their children.</p><p>Through the years, some of the Duggar siblings have bid farewell to reality TV stardom. <a href=#>Josh Duggar's 2015 scandals</a> not only got him kicked off TLC, but effectively ended 19 Kids & Counting for good. And in 2017, TLC cut ties with the Dillards following Jill's husband Derick's transphobic Twitter rants involving Jazz Jennings.</p><p>Now, it appears Joy-Anna and Austin Forsyth are the latest of the Duggar siblings leaving the family's show. But why is Joy Duggar not on Counting On? Let's take a closer look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So are Joy-Anna and Austin leaving 'Counting On'?</h2><p>Fans of the TLC series first suspected that Joy-Anna might not be appearing as much on the show when the promotional material for Season 11 dropped. Not only are Joy-Anna and her family not one of the featured storylines for the newest season of Counting On, but they didn't appear in the teaser video clip at all. See for yourself.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>It's a bit odd, right? The promotional video included Joy-Anna as one of the five pregnant Duggar women and yet, she didn't actually appear on camera at all. What gives?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Joy Duggar not on 'Counting On'?</h2><p>In June, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> reported Joy-Anna and Austin weren't filming for Season 11 of Counting On. For now, it seems the Forsyths are focusing their attention elsewhere ‚Äî and this shift in priorities makes sense considering the devastating loss they experienced last year.</p><p>In June 2019, Joy-Anna learned at 20 weeks along in her second pregnancy that she had suffered a miscarriage. "Today marks one week since we heard these words‚Ä¶ 'So this is your baby‚Äôs heart (pointing to the ultrasound screen). I don‚Äôt hear a heartbeat or see any movement.'" Joy captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2019, Instagram post</a>.</p><p>Joy-Anna went on to share that she and Austin named the baby girl they lost Annabell Elise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Today marks one week since we heard these words‚Ä¶ . ‚ÄúSo this is your baby‚Äôs heart (pointing to the ultrasound screen). I don‚Äôt hear a heartbeat or see any movement.‚Äù . We had gone in for our 20-week ultrasound and gender reveal. It was a baby girl. Although we don‚Äôt understand why, God has given us unexplainable peace and comfort during this very difficult time. Yes, it still hurts and we have cried countless tears, but we know that we can trust the Lord. In the words of King David after the loss of his baby, ‚ÄúI shall go to him, but he shall not return to me‚Äù (2 Sam 12:23). We don‚Äôt grieve as those who have no hope because we trust that we will see this little one again. We named her Annabell Elise. Annabell means ‚ÄúGod has favored me‚Äù, and Elise means ‚ÄúGod satisfies‚Äù. What a precious thing to know that when our daughter opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the face of Jesus. Please pray for continued healing, not only physically but for our hearts as well. . ‚ÄúAll the way my Savior leads me; What have I to ask beside? Can I doubt His tender mercy, Who through life has been my Guide? Heav‚Äônly peace, divinest comfort, Here by faith in Him to dwell! For I know, whate‚Äôer befall me, Jesus doeth all things well, For I know, whate‚Äôer befall me, Jesus doeth all things well.‚Äù -Fanny Crosby</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Joy Forsyth</a> (@austinandjoyforsyth) on Jul 3, 2019 at 8:01pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It's also not totally surprising that Joy and Austin are leaving Counting On, considering their changing social media habits ‚Äî which suggest they're setting themselves up for content creation apart from TLC.</p><p>The Forsyths now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have their own YouTube channel,</a> which Joy promotes via Instagram.

Still, we expect Joy and her family to casually pop up on-camera from time to time ‚Äî especially during family gatherings and big life events.</p><p>This is definitely a bummer for fans who have grown to love Joy, Austin, and their adorable son, Gideon.
