It comes at a point where the Jumia Group has grown in Africa like the Amazon for North America or Alibaba for Asia.</p><p>Kaymu - Nigeria’s largest online social marketplace has now become Jumia Market. With more innovative and exceptional services, Jumia Market, focused on remaining Africa's biggest social marketplace and and will continue to provide a superior customer experience, low commission rates, and a large assortment. This transformation in no way affects the core services which Kaymu, now Jumia Market has always been known for.</p><p>According to the results of a recent focus group survey carried out, 82% of the respondents reacted positively to Kaymu’s rebranding to Jumia Market while 7% are neutral. This aligns with Jumia Market’s promise that through new development, sellers will enjoy more visibility for their brands, best commission rates and by extension improved services than any other online platform.</p><p>According to Sefik Bagdadioglu, MD, Jumia Market Nigeria,<i> “This is an exciting time for us at Jumia Market as this rebranding represents our ambition and shows how the organization has advanced into a dynamic e-commerce firm as of late."</i> He further stated that <i>“Jumia Market will retain its established values at the same time develop a new and modern identity”.</i></p><p>To stay up to date with the offers, customers can now access Jumia Market through market.jumia.com.ng. On the new improved site,our customers will benefit from a richer shopping experience while having access to the same great products and services that were provided by Kaymu.</p><p>​</p><p><i>[Sponsored]</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhnF8l2psZqORrrq2ecisZKenp2K3trnImmSmmaKgsrV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
