She saw the High School Musical: The Musical: The Series cast and asked to get a photo with Joshua. He agreed, and led her to a remote alleyway where he tried kissing her even though Grace told him to stop. He continued to sexually assault her, groping her pants and violently grabbing her wrists so she couldn‚Äôt escape. Eventually she was able to flee, and tried to pretend like nothing happened.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúBELIEVE THE VICTIMS. It‚Äôs a very scary situation to be in and you will never understand unless you‚Äôve been in one before.
