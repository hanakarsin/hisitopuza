She clarified that she specifically asked for three bananas because she lives alone and couldn’t eat more than that without their going bad.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dani_mignone href=#>@dani_mignone</a><p>@Instacart needs to fix this 🤣😭 this should not be such a common occurrence ps i dont even like bananas that much <a title=instacartshopper href=#>#instacartshopper</a> <a title=instacartstorytime href=#>#instacartstorytime</a> <a title=grocerydeliveryservice href=#>#grocerydeliveryservice</a> <a title=grocerydeliverywentwrong href=#>#grocerydeliverywentwrong</a> <a title=instacartgonewrong href=#>#instacartgonewrong</a> <a title=ihave17bananas href=#>#ihave17bananas</a> <a title=deluludani href=#>#deluludani</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - dani_mignone" href=#>♬ original sound - dani_mignone</a></figure><p>So, you can imagine her surprise when she was given three bundles of fruit instead of three singles. “I literally have 17 bananas!” the bewildered creator exclaimed.</p><p>“I’m a single woman. There is no way I can eat 17 bananas before these go bad.” Dani then took to the caption to express her frustration by @ing Instacart. “This should not be such a common occurrence,” the TikToker wrote. “P.S. I don’t even like bananas that much.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The comment section offered advice about what to do with the 17 bananas.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@dani_mignone</span></figure><p>After Dani exasperatedly claimed that she couldn’t eat all 17 bananas before they went bad, folks in the comments section came to Dani’s rescue.
