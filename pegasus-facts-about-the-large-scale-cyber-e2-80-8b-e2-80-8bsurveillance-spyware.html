This applies to all phones,&nbsp;<strong>even those that are particularly secure such as the iPhone</strong>. And apparently, it would be able to read any type of chat, even if done with apps with end-to-end encryption, which encrypts it from the sender to the receiver. In the case of Pegasus, its programmers would have exploited the vulnerabilities of the software it interacts with. These are often&nbsp;<strong>0-Day, “known 0-day” software vulnerabilities</strong>, that is, unknown to the rest of the world, and which, sold and bought both in criminal circuits and through legal brokerage agencies, once discovered, are exploited to open the door to spy software.</p><p>It gets worse: for Guarnieri’s team, Nso technology makes it possible to&nbsp;<strong>penetrate phones with “zero-click attacks</strong>, that is, without a user having to click on a malicious link to get infected, while also finding evidence that Nso would have exploited the vulnerabilities associated with iMessage, which is installed on all iPhones.</p><p>According to Snowden,&nbsp;<strong>this is&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>the story of the year</a></strong>.&nbsp;With important legal and political implications.&nbsp;In fact, the lawsuit between Facebook and the Nso is still standing, considered by Zuckerberg’s lawyers to be responsible for hacking 1400 WhatsApp users.&nbsp;Thesis denied by the Israelis of Nso, who reacted to the accusation last year by counterattacking: according to the CEO of the company, two representatives of Facebook would have approached their executives in 2017 to&nbsp;<strong>buy the rights to use the surveillance software</strong>&nbsp;and monitor their users.&nbsp;Nso has invoked immunity to close the case, but in April two judges considered the request of the IT company premature.</p><p>Pegasus spyware was first&nbsp;<strong>discovered on iPhones in 2016</strong>, exploiting a vulnerability that was activated by clicking on a missed call from WhatsApp (it came from a Swedish prefix) capable of inoculating surveillance software, controlling the microphone and the camera. phone, collecting passwords and rummaging through photos and emails:&nbsp;<strong>Apple</strong>&nbsp;released an update in August 2016 aimed at closing the vulnerabilities.&nbsp;The same happened with&nbsp;<strong>Android</strong> devices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FpZqmdl5bAtr%2BMn5icrKNirqO71K1kraCVYrmivsaeZKybkaGybq%2FYm5yrZVV6f2aEj15ve111Z3J5fIRxeaytoquyqrjLmqWcnV2ovbrDwKucaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
