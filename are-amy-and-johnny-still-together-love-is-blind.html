These two lovebirds hit it off immediately, bonding over everything from <a href=#>anime</a> to their deep love for their families. But the burning question on everyone's minds: Are they still going strong?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, how are Amy and Johnny from 'Love Is Blind'?</h2><p>During Episode 12, Johnny and Amy both said "I do," making them the only couple to get married on Love Is Blind Season 6. They also appear to be the only couple in Love Is Blind history who said "I do" without having sex before their big day — power to you guys!</p><p>After the ceremony, Amy decided to keep her last name and hyphenate it with Johnny's, which makes her Mrs. Amy Cortez-McIntyre now. She expressed her gratitude for finding her soulmate and husband, saying, "I'm so grateful to have found my person - my husband." To celebrate their union, the newlyweds raised a glass of bubbly and exclaimed, "Love is blind!"</p><p>During the Season 6 reunion, Amy and Johnny confirmed they are still going.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Johnny and Amy said they wouldn't have taken the leap with anyone else.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Daily</a>, Johnny opened up about the behind-the-scenes reality of his and Amy's engagement, revealing that it wasn't quite the fairy-tale moment it appeared to be. In fact, he confessed that the whole experience felt rushed, shaking his nerves as he grappled with the weighty decision.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"I had an issue with the timing aspect of it," he explained to the outlet. "You're supposed to be engaged on day eight or day nine. We were definitely at the point of being boyfriend/girlfriend, but I didn't know what it was going to take to make that next leap into being an engaged couple."</p><p>As for Amy, the initial encounter with Johnny was a whirlwind of surprises. Despite admitting that Johnny wasn't her usual type physically, she couldn't deny the connection they shared.</p><p>"There were so many things going on in that moment. You're matching the voice to the face, and it's forming a puzzle of some sort," she recalled of first seeing Johnny. "He wasn't the type that I would've typically gone for in the past, but that doesn't change the fact that he's still handsome. Obviously, we had formed a mental and emotional connection, and I wanted to continue exploring that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Sure, proposal day may have been nerve-wracking, but both Johnny and Amy affirm that they couldn't imagine saying yes to anyone else in the Love Is Blind pods.</p><p>"I definitely talked to everyone that was there and we had good conversations," Johnny reflected. "But as far as on that next level of, 'Do I see myself spending the rest of my life with you?' it was really only Amy."</p><p>Amy echoed his sentiment, saying, "In the beginning, there were other connections, but I feel like I narrowed it down to Johnny just because of the special connection that we shared."</p><p>Season 6 of Love is Blind is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecCmsGaZnpl6q7vHp6WyZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzecuorZ5lmah6o7jIp5s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
