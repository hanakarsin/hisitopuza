Well, we're onto these celebrities who haven't aged in decades.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Spanish explorer Ponce de Le√≥n went looking for the Fountain of Youth in Florida, but it turns he was on the wrong coast. Clearly the real spring of eternal youth is in Hollywood, where some celebs seem to have gone literal decades without getting any older. Whether it's a fabled elixir of eternal life, good genes, or good doctors, these 18 stars are doing something right because, while they're certainly not getting any younger, they're definitely not getting any older.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Will Smith</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Will may have been immune to the vampire virus in I Am Legend but he definitely has some vampire blood IRL. How else can you explain the fact that he has literally not aged a day between these two photos, which were taken 20 years apart, btw. The photo on the left is from 1999, and the one on the right is from this year. Or is it the other way around? (It isn't, but we had to double check just to make sure.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Paul Rudd</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Paul Rudd's hair may have changed from that early '00s 'do on the left, but the rest of his visage is basically exactly as it was when we first fell in love with him in Clueless, which came out 24 years ago.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Jennifer Aniston</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>These photos were taken 18 years apart. Though Jen turned 50 this year, she basically looks just as she did 15 years ago when Friends ended. Maybe it's all the Smart Water she drinks?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Kristen Bell</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Kristen Bell made her Veronica Mars debut in 2004, and while 15 years have elapsed since she rolled up to Neptune High in her Chrysler LeBaron, the 38-year-old could still easily pass as student. She sticks to a mostly plant-based diet, though she does eat dairy and eggs in moderation. She's also big on skincare and is very religious about wearing sunscreen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Keanu Reeves</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The only sign Keanu Reeves has aged in the past two decades are the one or two stray gray whiskers in his beard. That man on the right is in his mid 50s, if you can believe.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Gabrielle Union</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When Gabrielle Union led the Compton Clovers to victory in 2000's Bring It On, she had already been out of high school for almost decade. Now 46 years old, we're pretty sure she could still don that cheer uniform and look exactly as she did 19 years ago. She says she drinks a gallon of water a day and maintains a diet of lean proteins and vegetables.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Gladys Knight</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Gladys recently wowed audiences on <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>, but what really impressed us is how much she's managed to stay young. This woman is a great-grandma!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Cher</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"If I could turn back time," Cher? I think it's pretty clear you can. The "Believe" singer isn't shy about the fact that she's had a little help staying young, but come on. This woman is 72 years old!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Pharrell Williams</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Pharrell Williams is 45 years old. And yet he looks basically identical to how he did in 2002 when he was producing records for No Doubt, Britney Spears, and Jay Z. Being "Happy" really does keep you young! He also says he eschews cleansers on his face and instead just uses cold water to rinse off and tighten his pores.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Daddy Yankee</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you took a photo from every year of Daddy Yankee's career (which spans over 25 years), jumbled them around on your desk, and then had to determine the youngest photo in that lineup, there's no way you could do it. Not only has his face stayed the same, but his style has been pretty consistent for a quarter of a century.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Halle Berry</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>How is this woman 52? She looks just as dewy as the day she accepted the NAACP Image Award on the left. And that day was 19 years ago. She says exercise is her biggest beauty secret and feels cardio is the key to maintaining her complexion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Taraji P. Henson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Taraji has been in the game for a long time, but it's har to fault people who thought she was new in town when she got the role of Cookie Lyon on Empire. After all, she basically hasn't changed in the almost two decades since she starred in Baby Boy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Enrique Iglesias</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=#>Enrique Iglesias</a> is 43 years old, and the only change to his face in the past few years is a different stubble pattern, slightly more chiseled cheekbones, and his since-removed mole. Also, please take a moment to envy his lashes, which are still as lush and puppy-like as when he debuted "Bailamos."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Adam Levine</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, NBC</span></figure><p>The only way to do age progression on Adam Levine is through his tattoos. Every year, his body gets more and more covered, yet his face stays exactly the same.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Victoria Beckham</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Victoria Beckham is kind of famous for never smiling, and while she has said it's because she has "a responsibility to the fashion community," whatever that means, it could definitely be a strategy to keep the laugh lines at bay. Whether that's the reason or a happy coincidence, it's paid off. She looks the same as the day she married Becks nearly 20 years ago.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Salma Hayek</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Salma Hayek is 52 years old. &nbsp;And yet she looks exactly as she did in her mid 30s, which is when the photo on the left was taken. One of her secrets to staying young is never washing her face in the morning. "My grandmother taught me that at night your skin replenishes all the things you lost during the day, she said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 NY Times interview</a>. "Also, if I cleanse very well at night, why would it be dirty when I wake up?"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. Jared Leto</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The 30 Seconds to Mars frontman is 47 years old, and yet, does he really look much older than he did when he was breaking hearts on My So-Called Life at age 21? Jared's secrets are a vegan diet and abstaining from booze. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2013, he told GQ</a>, "I still have plenty of vices, but alcohol isn't one of them. It's probably just down to sleep and diet."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Jennifer Lopez</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>JLo turns 50 this year, but don't tell her face or body that. If possible, she looks even better at 49 as she did at the 2000 Grammys (pictured left).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKtscGroK2hlah6uLTOZqWerpWneqKzxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
