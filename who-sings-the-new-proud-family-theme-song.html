From <a href=#>Power’s</a> “Big Rich Town” by 50 Cent to <a href=#>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’s</a> “Yo Home to Bel-Air” by Will Smith, a good theme song serves up the perfect dose of nostalgia. And such is the case with Disney’s classic, <a href=#>The Proud Family</a>.</p><p>The original Proud Family theme song was performed by Solange Knowles and Destiny’s Child. But, with the reboot of the cartoon classic, showrunners decided to switch things up a little bit. So, who sings <a href=#>The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder</a> theme song? Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joyce Wrice sings the new 'Proud Family' theme song.</h2><p>With reboots typically come major changes, so it isn't a surprise that fans have questions about the iconic Proud Family theme song. The melodies from Destiny’s Child and Solange aren't only top-notch, but seem to pair perfectly with the time period of the show. However, show runners have introduced a brand new version featuring singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joyce Wrice</a>.</p><p>Since the show is now based on the state of pop culture today, it makes sense for showrunners to switch things up. With mentions of Lizzo and Chloe x Halle, it’s clear that the writers wanted the show to reflect the current times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@joycewrice</a></figure><p>With a new rebrand and the cast being older in mind, the remixed song aligns with the show's vision. Aside from those who are sad to see the classic tune go, most people agree that it still gives a nostalgic vibe. And thanks to original producer and songwriter Kurt Farquhar collaborating with Joyce, the track offers a modern, soulful feel.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure it still felt very nostalgic and classic,” Joyce said in her February 2022 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nylon</a> interview. “That was my goal. And the best way for me to do that was to keep the original in mind, but also bring what I have to offer. A lot of people say that they like my tone, so I really finessed my tone and thought about artists that I grew up listening to. When certain parts had to be sung, I thought about Brandy. I definitely thought about Destiny’s Child, and Solange, and Mariah Carey. And I thought about myself, as a genuine fan. What do I want to hear years later?”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joyce Wrice is a rising R&B star.</h2><p>Aside from showcasing her vocal skills on The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder theme song, Joyce has been making waves in the R&B world. The 29-year-old released her debut album “Overgrown” in 2021. The 14-track project consists of soothing melodies and powerful verses with features that include Lucky Daye, Kaytranada, Masego, and Freddie Gibbs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joyce Wrice (@joycewrice)</a></p></figure><p>“[Overgrown] was everything I would want my album to be,” Joyce tells the outlet. “There's so much balance in the production, but it's still very pure and sweet R&B.” More recently, she released Motive, and has since appeared on NPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert” series. Joyce spends a lot of time hustling, so as far as we can tell, she isn't currently dating anyone. But she has our love.</p><p>The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder Season 2 drops new episodes every Wednesday on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedKipaCrXam1pnnNnq5mqKKkwqV5xZqkoqSpYsGpscyeZKynnpw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
