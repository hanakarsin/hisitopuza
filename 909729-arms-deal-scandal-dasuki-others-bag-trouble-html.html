Once they are set free by the court, they will have their money back. So, they have nothing to lose at all.</i></p><p><i>“The blockage of the accounts is not peculiar to our jurisdiction at all. Go and find out the situation in other countries too.”</i></p><p>The source explained that&nbsp;the Post No Bill (PNB) measure might remain in force until when either the fate of all those affected has been determined or after an agreement has been sealed on plea bargain.</p><p>Speaking on the difficulty experienced since the accounts were frozen, one of the suspects, who spoke in confidence said it had been difficult paying accruing bills.</p><p>The suspect said: “<i>The EFCC has blocked or placed PNB on our accounts. We are virtually living from hands to mouth because the sanctions have affected some accounts that are not directly related to the arms cash.</i></p><p><i>“Some of our children are also stranded abroad because we cannot pay school fees. We need some relief from the EFCC. Let the ban be relaxed so that we can have limited access to some funds.</i></p><p><i>“Some friends and associates, who have been assisting, are also overstretched. Some are afraid of the EFCC. They don’t want to have any direct financial dealings with us.</i></p><p><i>“A few of us have offered to go into plea bargain. This development should make the EFCC to have faith in us.</i></p><p><i>“Those who have opted for trial want the court to treat all cases with speed in order to get over these matters.”</i></p><p>In another development, human rights activist and top legal luminary, Femi Falana (SAN) has revealed how an ex-governor tried to bribe him with N405 million to help steal funds abroad.</p><p>Falana, The Nation reports, also asked legal practitioners to avoid being tempted into assisting politically exposed persons in committing financial crimes.</p><p>The respected legal practitioner’s statement at an anti-corruption workshop in Abuja was made available in the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) monthly magazine, ALERT, obtained by journalists on Friday, July 29.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhnGFlmtwZpmiosBusMSao2ark5a7pa3LZpuaq6Wgtm6706Gcq6tdl66oedOrpq6anJp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
