Per an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official press release</a> from the organization, the honorees for this year include actor <a href=#>George Clooney</a>, singer-songwriter <a href=#>Amy Grant</a>, soul, Gospel, R&B, and pop singer Gladys Knight, composer and conductor Tania León, and rock band U2.</p><p>The event is a "tribute to our nation’s preeminent artists with performances by the great stars of today who have followed in their footsteps." Each year, performers who were inspired by the honorees are selected to grace the stage at the Kennedy Center Honors. The catch?
