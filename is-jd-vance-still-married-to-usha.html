Now, however, his name is thrust into the spotlight and under potential scrutiny of the public eye as he and his family are part of a much larger campaign than ever before. And those who briefly followed his political career before now want to know if JD Vance is still married to <a href=#>Usha Vance</a>, his wife.</p><p>Usha is no stranger to politics herself, though her experience is on a much smaller scale than that of her husband, especially now that he is Trump's running mate as the Republican vice presidential candidate for the 2024 election. Over the course of her career following her education at Yale and University of Cambridge, Usha worked as a clerk for both Chief Justice John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, and she was a lawyer for the firm Munger, Tolles & Olson.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@teamjdvance</a></figure><p>With JD's place at Trump's side, however, a rep from the firm revealed in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that "has decided to leave the firm." And many want to know what that means for her professional future and personal life with JD.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is JD Vance still married to Usha Vance?</h2><p>While it's not immediately clear why some are confused about whether or not JD is still married to his wife Usha, they appear to still be married and going strong as JD enters the thick of it ahead of the 2024 election. In June 2024, before JD was announced as Trump's running mate, the couple spoke with Fox News about the potential for JD to enter the White House, and at that time, Usha spoke highly of her husband's political future.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JD Vance (@teamjdvance)</a></p></figure><p>She was also seen supporting her husband on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024, and she remains by his side. Which, according to JD, is something he needs both professionally and personally.</p><p>In a 2020 interview on The Megyn Kelly Show, he shared, "Usha definitely brings me back to earth. If I get a little too cocky or a little too proud, I remind myself that she's way more accomplished than I."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did JD Vance say about Trump and Hitler before he was his running mate?</h2><p>Though JD is part of the Republican party, he previously spoke less than highly of his running mate. Ahead of the 2016 election, which Trump would eventually win, JD called Trump "reprehensible" and was critical of the then-presidential candidate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tweet deleted by JD Vance when he ran for Senate:</p><p>“Trump makes people I care about afraid.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, JD wrote in private messages that he wondered if Trump was "America's Hitler." Now, things have clearly drastically changed, as JD has aligned himself with Trump as his running mate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsNmrZqmk5p6tMDIpaNmpZGnv6qxw2arqGWlqLWi</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
