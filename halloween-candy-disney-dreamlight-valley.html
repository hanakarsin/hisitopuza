All around the map, there are various buckets of Halloween candy scattered. As you play the game, you'll want to venture to these spots and pick up the buckets, collecting all of the candy inside. This is really all you need to do to collect candy, and while you may think you'll only need a few pieces, you'll want to stockpile it if you plan to complete all of the Halloween duties.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a way to get the Halloween buckets to spawn, as they are randomly generated. If you're still short on the number of candies you need, you'll just have to wait for more to spawn around the map.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What can you do with the Halloween candy?</h2><p>There are a couple of duties posted for the Halloween season in Disney Dreamlight Valley that take advantage of the abundance of Halloween candy you'll find around the map.</p><p>The first task that will require Halloween candy is a 3-Course Halloween Meal. For this task, all you have to do is eat three different colored pieces of candy (which come from different colored Halloween buckets). You'll receive a Trick or Treater’s Bounty for completing this one.</p><p>Next, you'll want to eat 45 pieces of candy to complete the Sugar Rush task. There are three tiers to this one, giving you three different prizes: You'll get the Happy Jack O’Lantern after eating 15 pieces, the Mischievous Jack O’Lantern after eating 30, and the Friendly Jack O’Lantern after eating 45.</p><p>These two quests are really the only ones you'll need the candy for — but obtaining 45 pieces to complete Sugar Rush may take a bit of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6tuM6wnJ6mXZiur7DYZpuiq56axm6w0Z6YpqSZnLW1edWao6WdqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
