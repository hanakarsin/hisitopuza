Let's unpack what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Rob Bogaerts / Anefo / Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Miep Gies' cause of death?</h2><p>Not only did Miep Gies accomplish feats that helped shape the course of modern history, she also lived quite a long life. Born on Feb. 15, 1909, Miep lived to be 100 years old, having died on Jan. 11, 2010. As for her cause of death, it was unfortunately attributed to injuries she suffered as a result of a fall at her nursing home in Hoorn, The Netherlands, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>Miep, along with other employees of Otto Frank, Anne's father, supplied food and water to the Frank family and the other Jewish hideouts while they stayed in a secret part of the attic above Otto's business in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation of the area. Miep was able to keep the family safe until Aug. 4, 1944, when she was approached by an officer with the Gr√ºne Polizei, who had been tipped off that Jewish people were being hidden in on the premises.</p><p>Miep managed to avoid persecution for her role in protecting the Frank family and others because she recognized the arresting officer's accent as being from Vienna, her hometown. After sympathizing with him, he agreed to leave her be.</p><p>Miep attempted to buy the Frank family's freedom, but was denied the ability to do so. When the war ended, it was confirmed that Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Rob Bogaerts / Anefo / Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>After the Frank family's initial arrest, Miep retrieved parts of Anne's diary and hid them safely until the end of the war. When fighting ceased, Miep gave stewardship of the diary to Otto, being the only surviving member of the family. Miep admitted that she had never read the diary prior to giving it to Otto and said that if she did, she likely would have destroyed it as it contained her name and the names of others who helped hide the Franks from the Nazis.</p><p>Otto published his daughter's diary in 1947. He was only able to persuade Miep to read it after "prolonged insistence," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AnneFrank.org</a>. Over the years that followed, Miep was given an array of awards such as the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Wallenberg medal, and the Yad Vashem Righteous Among the Nations medal.</p><p>On top of that, Miep was knighted in the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and even had a minor planet named after her: 99949 Miepgies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforamvIygoJ6rXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
