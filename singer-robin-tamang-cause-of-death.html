After the band's success, Robin also released solo music, including his 2003 album "Mero Euta Sathi Cha," which was met with substantial acclaim when it was initially released. Robin followed up that effort with additional solo albums, including one that was named after the country he called home.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Robin collaborated with a number of other prominent Nepali musicians and international artists over the course of his career, including Adrian Pradhan, Shreya Sotang, and Kutumba.</p><p>In addition to his musical work, Robin was also widely known for his contributions to the Nepali film industry.

We only met a couple of weeks ago and he'd told us how he's changed his lifestyle because he felt he was getting old. We told him he'd remain forever young. That's how we'll always remember him.
