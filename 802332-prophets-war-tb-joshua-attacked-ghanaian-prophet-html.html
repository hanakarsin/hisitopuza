Pray for these two nations – Nigeria and Ghana – over gathering in any way; over an attack. I am seeing the attack and that will be in a foreign way. The attack will come not in a local way. So please open your lips and pray for these two nations for protection.”</i></p><p>But his controversial prophecy which stirred so much panic in Ghana,&nbsp; has been met with a lot of criticisms with many religious bodies including the Christian Council calling on security agencies to ignore it since Ghana cannot run on “the back of prophecies.”</p><p>In support, the outspoken Kwabena Tawiah stressed that the prophecy must be treated with the contempt it deserves.</p><p>Describing TB Joshua’s prophecy as unnecessary, the Church of Rabbi leader said assuming without admitting that the prophecy is true, God would have revealed it to a Ghanaian prophet and not a foreigner.</p><p><i>“What is TB Joshua saying; he should leave Ghana alone and concentrate on Boko Haram in Nigeria”</i> he fumed.</p><p>Kwabena Tawiah also urged TB Joshua to support President Buhari with his prophecies to help arrest the Boko Haram insurgents terrorizing citizens in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Malawi president replies TB Joshua over death vision</p><p>TB Joshua has in recent times, had to face great controversy regarding his ministry in Ghana. It would be recalled that a few weeks back he was accused by Kwaku Bonsam who is also know as <i>'Devil of Wednesday'.</i></p><p>The <i>Devil of Wednesday </i>who is said to be very powerful, boasted that he’s the ‘spiritual father’ of some of the most powerful preachers in Africa, TB Joshua inclusive.</p><p>Kwaku said: <i>“Over 1, 700 pastors and so called men of God from different parts of Africa have approached me, seeking powers to perform miracles, including Prophet T.B Joshua from Nigeria. He is my boy. I challenge him to come out and deny this.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXF%2BkmxpZqiipL2psdOsZLCZomLBo3nJqKqhrZFirrXAwJyinpxdnLWiusCimKdloKe8sbTErWWhrJ2h</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
