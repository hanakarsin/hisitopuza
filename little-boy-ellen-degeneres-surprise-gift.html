He made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show last week in full-face glam make-up and did something very few adults would be brave enough to do on live TVâ€”belt out "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" from Dreamgirls.&nbsp;</p><p>Reuben, who has a small but dedicated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube following</a>, started out singing on his karaoke machine. He attracted enough attention to earn an appearance on Little Big Shots, hosted by Steve Harvey. When asked where he got a beautiful voice, he very sweetly told Ellen, "I think it just came from the inside." And practice, he admits. Reuben also does all his own make-up and has been doing it since he was about 8.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ellen asked if he wears make-up to school, and Reuben said he does. She asked if he was bullied and Reuben explained that he was bullied for a few months. "In my drama group, I used to get hit, punched, and kicked," he said, "After two months, I tried to brush it off, but brushing it off doesn't work. So I stood up to them and I told my mom." Reuben got moved to a new school and has found his new classmates far more accepting. As they should be, because Reuben is a star:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Ellen congratulated him, saying, "Well, good for you for not stopping being who you are, that's really tough." &nbsp;She added, "And you look fantastic."</p><p>Later Ellen asked what he wants to be when he grows up, and to the audience's pleasure he said "a Kardashian," explaining that he'd like to have his own make-up brand, website, and YouTube channel with his sister. Luckily, Ellen set him up with exactly what he needs to make his dreams come true, including a make-up set, a new computer, and a backdrop with the whole Kardashian brood to stand behind him. Reuben's excitement was hard to capture:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Ellen</a></figure><p>But I think we will have a lot more of Reuben to look forward to if he was able to accomplish this much before he even got his own box light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYCOa2xosnGbhZJ7y6KrraSVYq%2BwxYyeo6WdnmKxprPEp5yrnaNiwLa%2Bz6ugrJ1dnLanwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
