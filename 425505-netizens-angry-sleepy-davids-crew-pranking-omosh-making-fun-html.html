You are all mean for no reason. Omosh is sick. It's not his liking and making fun of him like this isn't okay."</i><p class=align-left>@heisronny said:</p><i>"Man! That sleepy David guy had to throw Omosh under the bus just to market his bottom of the barrel YouTube channel."</i><p class=align-left>@Mejja commented:</p><i>"But guys the things you are doing to Omosh is not good. Treat him like one of our own! I'm not happy with you people. Can you all just let him live his life?"</i><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d9aa6432a4fc2136.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ex-Tahidi High Actor Eddy Says Omosh Has Shamed Other Actors for Nearly Selling Gift House</span></p></a><p class=align-left>@j_ekitela added:</p><i>"The money you didn't sweat for is easy to waste. #omosh."</i><p class=align-left>@ButterBullet_ commented:</p><i>"Every day it's Omosh this Omosh that.
