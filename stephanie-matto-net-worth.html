In one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> that she posted, Stephanie told fans that she made about $50,000 in one week alone from selling jarred farts.</p><p>Her TikTok has blown up ever since news of her selling farts hit the mainstream, with her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original video</a> about selling farts reaching almost seven million views.</p><p>However, she shared with Distractify, she had to give up that particular revenue stream for her health.</p><p>"I suffered a 'fart attack,'" she said. "Which sounds funny, but to be fair, it's more common than you think. I was eating way too much food and protein that day, I think all of it was causing so much gas build up that I mistook it for heart attack symptoms and ended up in the ER. After they ran a bunch of tests and told me it wasn't a heart attack, I was discharged with instructions to take tums and rest, and decided no more fart jars. Or at least not for a while."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stephanie Matto (@stepankamatto)</a></p></figure><p>After she gave that up, Stephanie began selling her boob sweat in a jar. And so far, that has proven equally as lucrative for the reality TV star. She also told us that she launched her own online subscription platform, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unfiltrd</a>.</p><p>She originally started selling her farts and boob sweat in an effort to draw attention to her website and to encourage other content creators to think of similarly unique ideas. But Stephanie has definitely cornered the market on selling her bodily fluids.</p><p>"I think people see those headlines and sometimes forget that I am also the founder and CEO of a really successful fan subscription website and work my butt off," Stephanie said. "I bring a lot of PR and a lot of money to this platform so I can build features that other sex workers and creators can use to then make money with."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmvMeapaKdXaKutcDOZqWerF2svLPAxw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
