But for us in Rivers State, we are solidly behind the presidency of our national leader, Aaiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He is a detribalised man that has done so well for our democracy over the years.</p><p>“A lot of people say that Tinubu has a lot of money, what is he going to the presidency to do! But I believe that Tinubu is going to the presidency to make things better for Nigerians. He has the capacity and the ability to fix the economy of the country.”</p><p>“The target of the ENDSARS Protest was Tinubu. They wanted to eliminate him because of his popularity. That was why they burnt up his hotel, his TV station and the newspaper office.</p><p>“Why must anybody say that Tinubu is too old to be president? I don’t think that is correct. It will only be fair to allow Tinubu to become the next President of Nigeria giving his enormous contributions to our democracy”, he said.</p><p>He also called on the leadership of the party in the state to give Magnus Abe the opportunity of becoming the next governor of Rivers State in 2023.</p><p>Ake added that the Rivers South-East where Senator Abe comes from is the only senatorial district that has not produced the Governor of the state.</p><p>Tony Okocha, the former chief of staff during the administration of Rotimi Amaechi, said Tinubu has the ability to transform the country as he did in Lagos State.</p><p>“Tinubu is the champion of Nigeria’s democracy. He has the capacity to turn around the economy of Nigeria the same way he did in Lagos as Governor. For a man that midwife the development of Lagos State to what it is today, I believe that the same man if given the opportunity can make Nigeria great again,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5BsZp6mlKius7%2BMraCnrZKqerit0maYZqyRp7SmwIyonWasmJp6sb7OrZysrF2WuKZ5wqWYoqWjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
