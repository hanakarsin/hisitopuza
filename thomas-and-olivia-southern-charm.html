Dumb. [It was a] drunken night. One time,” she confessed during part 1 of the Season 9 reunion, which aired on Jan. 11, 2024. “I had a hookup with T-Rav. I wanted to take it to my grave, like, who wouldn’t?”</p><p>Given that information, we can assume that Thomas and Olivia hooked up in either 2012 or 2013 when he was in his early 50s.</p><p>Olivia's shocking confession didn't just come out of the blue, though.</p><p>Previously, <a href=#>Madison LeCroy</a> had publicly accused Thomas and Olivia of hooking up during the Season 8 reunion in 2022. At the time, Olivia had denied the accusation. “Me having sex with Thomas? No, he’s like a family friend.”</p><p>Taylor even came to Olivia's defense, as she wasn't aware of the truth.</p><p>However, after they finished filming the Season 8 special, Olivia told Taylor the truth.</p><p>“I sat down with Taylor, and I said, ‘I appreciate you taking up for me, but you should know something did happen,’” Olivia recounted. “She’s the only person I told on earth about that. And here you are sitting here now trying to use that against me.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo / Heidi Gutmn</span><p>The 'Southern Charm' Season 8 reunion, where Madison LeCroy first hinted about Oliva and Thomas's hookup</p></figure><p>Taylor claimed that she was not comfortable with knowing this information given that Olivia is a “friend and confidant” of Thomas's ex-girlfriend Kathryn Dennis, who shares two children with Thomas.</p><p>However, Olivia claimed that she didn't know Kathyrn at the time and met her after it happened. She further explained that she has “no idea” if Kathryn and Thomas were still together when they hooked up, but she didn’t “believe so.” (Kathryn and Thomas dated on and off for years, but finally split in 2016).</p><p style=text-align:start>Olivia also alleged that Taylor has been “sitting there chomping at the bit to use that against me." Tensions are definitely high, as Olivia felt that Taylor purposely called her out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWwucCsZJqmlGK8rbXVophmq5%2Bqwamx0adknKCRp7o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
