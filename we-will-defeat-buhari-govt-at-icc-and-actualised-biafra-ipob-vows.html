Nigeria has a history of impunity when it comes to adherence to court orders and judgments issued by courts of competent jurisdiction, so we are not surprised that the Nigeria establishment in collaboration with purveyors of falsehood have continued to thread the same part of shamelessly dishing out lies and propaganda against us despite a ruling by her own court that IPOB is not unlawful.</p><p>“History they say is the best teacher and we, therefore, want to remind our oppressors that a Federal High Court, in Abuja, presided over by Justice Binta Nyako, had on March 2, 2017, ruled that “IPOB is not an unlawful organization.” The court which struck out six of the 11-count criminal charge the Federal Government preferred against our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and three other pro-Biafra agitators, declared that IPOB was not unlawful.</p><p>“In the landmark ruling, the court said that the fact that IPOB was not an organization registered in Nigeria did not make it an illegal society. In her words, the Honourable Justice ruled thus, “It may be true that IPOB is not registered in Nigeria, but does that make it an illegal organization?” the judge queried.</p><p>“Justice Nyako held that the Federal Government failed to prove that IPOB, allegedly managed by Kanu and his co-defendants — Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawuisi, is an unlawful society. So, if the federal government could not prove that IPOB is a terrorist organization before its own court, is it then before the ICC (International Criminal Court) that it can prove the contrary?</p><p>“The Nigeria Government already knows that we are prepared for it at the International Criminal Court, ICC. Just very soon we shall meet there! The whole world is also aware of all the atrocities of the Nigeria Government through the instrumentality of its terrorist security agencies against the innocent and non-violent people of Biafra. Very soon we shall get the justice that we have been asking for. Biafra shall be actualised in our lifetime.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FqZrCdXay2rbiMnZyfnZGpeqPBx5qpomWXpMO1ecCtZKKbk2Kur7CMmpqtrZGhtrSxw2aZopmWp65utc%2BomWaun6zAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
